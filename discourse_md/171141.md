Please post any discrepancies related to project1.
@carlton
Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?
All the image ids we evaluated were what you submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us.
For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.
How to fix bugs in our scripts

Bug fixes
If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.

What is the highest mark anyone has scored? Is it 22/20
@Carlton?

**Post ID:** 612331

How come me and my group used same code but some got 10 some 11 some 12?

**Post ID:** 612332

@carlton Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.
We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.

**Post ID:** 612333

You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.

**Post ID:** 612334

I have noticed that my image was run on a x86_64 architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is ARM. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error.
This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

**Post ID:** 612335

My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389

We will check and rerun on arm if we ran it on the wrong emulation.

@carlton  same issue, My image was also run on a x86_64 architecture. I too built on my mac which is ARM (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error  and  Evaluation log file is MISSING.
Actually my image was run on x86_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.
I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.
the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL,
What was evaluated? How it was evaluated?
This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07
My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.

@carlton @Jivraj
I wanted to kindly request if you could review the bonus additional tasks, as they were not reflected in the evaluation, despite being mentioned in the instructions. Apart from that I understand and accept my score overall, especially since I had hardcoded the folder paths in my prompt for some questions, which I believe led to those failures.

Bonus: Additional tasks. We may pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.

The task was done but the LLM made a mistake. I think this type of mistake was outside our control. @carlton

**Post ID:** 612359

@carlton @Jivraj
Please correct me if I’m wrong, but I noticed that for tasks B7, B8, and B10, the evaluation log does not include any POST or GET request traces, unlike the other tasks which have clearly recorded request flows, generated code, and outputs. In these three cases, the log shows only the failure message without any indication that the script was executed or that the output file was read.

Hi @all
We will identify why arm images created a problem and were run using x86 platform.
We will also rerun evaluations for all the x86 and arm images one more time, before pushing to the dashboard.

Hi @jivraj,


@23f3003302 output from your server’s response is correct, we will update our evaluation script.

@23f2004912 We will discuss internally if we can do something about it, but I can’t assure if you will get marks for it, since output from your server is a bit different.

It would have run at your end but it was supposed to run at anywhere, after dockerising it didn’t run, reason is taskA module was not found.

Same issue for me sir. When I evaluated my file using evaluate.py my 9 cases out of the 10 in Task A was passed but the email I received shows that my evaluation log file is missing. I don’t understand why does it show like that. Please do check and help me out sir.

**Post ID:** 612391

@Jivraj , @carlton
It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the os library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.”
I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.

Same here. I also dis not recieve any mail sir.

**Post ID:** 612407

I noticed that my Docker image was run on an x86_64 architecture (as indicated by my email in the shared logs), whereas I originally built it on my Mac (ARM architecture). Due to this mismatch, the image failed to run properly and resulted in an exec format error.
Since there was no prior mention of the architecture on which our images would be evaluated, I request that my evaluation be conducted again on the appropriate machine. Please help as after doing it correctly getting 0 marks because of such an error feels wrong

**Post ID:** 612408

@23f2001975 we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation.
If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix.
We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation. So we will check your image on arm.
Kind regards

This is a screenshot of my docker log file. This works if you pass the actual value of the airproxy token at the command line while pulling the docker image. Please do look into this as I’ve put a lot of effort into this.

My image was also run on a x86_64 architecture. I too built on my mac which is ARM (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the exec format error and Evaluation log file is MISSING.
Can you please rerun the image on ARM based

**Post ID:** 612412

You have a misspelling in your environment variable, thats why it failed. We do pass the token to your docker exactly as specified in Project 1 page.

@carlton @Jivraj what do I do sir am seriously clueless and heartbroken rn pls help atleast for A tasks we should get it

**Post ID:** 612417

We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field.
Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those.
If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run.
Kind regards

@carlton
I encountered an HTTP 500 error with the following detail:
{
"detail": "'choices'"
}

This issue appears across all tasks, even though they were running fine before submission. I suspect there might be a problem with APIPROXY_TOKEN. Could you please look into this?
Additionally, my solution is very similar to the one shared by the System Commands team in their email.

Yes, I agree.
So, did my docker ID change when I submitted?
I am sorry sir, but I did not make any changes after submitting the project, so I guess my Docker ID should remain the same as before, if I am not mistaken. I kindly request you to check just once more please, as I really don’t know where I have went wrong.
Jivraj Sir had checked liked this for another student, so I just wanted to confirm the same for me.

Hi @carlton !
I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking!
Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review.

**Post ID:** 612463

 ROHIT_B_LAKSHMANAN:

what is the reason for this?
It was running properly before, please help.


Try running docker container after pulling, check if evaluate.py is able to do it’s job.
If you feel there is some issues from our side, we have provided with scirpts we used. You can create a pull request to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1

No no sir, I can send you an SS of my code, it’s very much there sir, the tasksA file, i really don’t know why this happened.

Same issue with me also

**Post ID:** 612500

Yeah, it’s there on your local machine, but you didn’t copy it to docker container.
Below is content of your docker file which doesn’t copy tasksA.py file it only copies app.py. You could have figured this out by just running docker container on your local machine earlier, it would have shown you that error.
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

@carlton good afternoon sir,
I completed my project 1 and submitted it as instructed. But the result show that evaluate file missing. I did everything right but don’t know how this as the result come. I also had evaluation file in my project too. Please go through things again as this is very unfair for those who took 2 weeks to do this project. My roll no. is 22f3001664. I hope I will get marks, of not full then should be 10/20.
Thank you sir

Figure out the problem in our script and do a pull request to it, we will fix it if it’s a valid bug.

**Post ID:** 612520

We looked at your script and there are errors in it. It doesn’t follow what we mentioned in live sessions.
Line number 81 of your app.py
subprocess.run(["uv", "run", script_name, "--root", "./data"] + args, check=True)
which creates a data directory inside app directory but evaluate.py expects data directory to be in root directory.

@Jivraj @carlton
I’m writing here to express my concerns regarding the evaluation of my TDS Project-1. Also, kindly pardon me for the long message.
I have received a MISSING statement in my evaluation log file in the project 1 score mail that was released yesterday.
These are the detailed point wise concerns :


I at the earlier stages, found the Tools in Data Science course relatively challenging as it’s just my second term in Diploma and I have only completed BDM and MLF Course till now. Hence, I decided to drop the course in February, however when I could still view the course on the portal, and raised concerns, the assistance provided to me was very grim and low, and after numerous follow-ups, I was finally informed 2½ weeks after dropping my course, that my drop application was received in draft and they would not proceed with it, and I had to continue my course.


By this time, I had already missed 2 graded assignment deadlines and the project 1 submission was due in the coming 2 days. Not losing my spirit and with whatever I could learn and implement I completed the TDS project 1. However, I accidentally attached the wrong docker image link, and I also raised the issue, but didn’t receive a reply.


I understand that it was a fault on my part, but evaluating a student as 0, even though all their functions are right, and they give the required answers, is also wrong since we are expected to provide correct answers, and learn to build the docker image, however, there can be occurrences where a student might make a small mistake like uploading the wrong link, and they must be given a small chance to reprimand them.


I also didn’t receive the mail from the TDS Team which they issued for students whose docker image or GitHub link was erroneous, and hence I realised after the deadline that I had uploaded the wrong docker image link.


I have rechecked all my function, and they are all correct, giving a 0 to a student, who worked hard within the limited available time(given the student had dropped the course but the course team didn’t process it) is very unfair.
Kindly provide me a way to either re-upload my project-1 Docker image link, or ask them to provide me marks on the basis of the functions and codes written, whichever is feasible, atleast to encourage the efforts and time put into the project with little knowledge.
I hope you would look into my plight, and take necessary measures.
Thanks and Regards

Few Students including me have not received any mails regarding TDS Project 1. We don’t even know what went wrong or why we didn’t received. Initially I thought that it can be due to some sending error and i will receive little late but even after 14hrs we have not received anything from the team. How are we supposed to check log and see our mistakes when we didn’t even received marks and logs. I request to check into it and provide us our marks and logs.
Thank You.

One issue file is my app is listening on port 8000. But evaluations being done on 8219 port. so how it will succeed. Please guide what to do.

**Post ID:** 612599

That’s external port mapping, we mapped your docker’s port 8000 to external 8219 port, so it won’t create issues.
Just look at docker_orchestration.py file for logic behind it, basically it was for evaluating multiple images parallely.

Sir, my evaluation log file is missing, even though I followed all the steps to generate the Docker image correctly. The system indicates that the server didn’t start within 5 minutes, but when I uploaded it, everything was working fine. I put in a lot of effort into this project, and I’m worried I might receive a zero despite making the submission correctly. Kindly help me resolve this issue. My roll number is 22F3004068.
Additionally, my Docker image ID was d2f27c03b878, but the ID mentioned in the email was dfac8596cd4c. Please provide clarity on this discrepancy.

I realized that I made a mistake in my project by forgetting to uncomment a single line of code: os.path.join(os.getcwd(), “path_given”). I feel really bad about this oversight, especially after working so hard on the project and formatting everything carefully. It was an honest mistake, and I take full responsibility for it.
I sincerely request you to consider re-evaluating my work, as I believe it reflects the effort and dedication I put into it. I truly regret this error and will be more careful in the Project 2

My docker logs shows that OSError: Cannot find resource error occurred when the data generation script tried to access font files in generation for a8.
[Image at https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/f/dfc4c289dcc2ddda315bd9f97a9ff21c166792af.png]image1485×807 37.4 KB
The datagen.py script looked for Arial font in the try block and when it encountered error it went to the except block to use DejaVuSans, the Pillow default, except it encountered the same error there, which was not handled. Thus, datagen.py stopped abruptly without creating files for A9 and A10 as well. So effectively, my A9 and A10 did not get evaluated properly as it did not have the required files due to error during data generation for A8. Can you please re-evaluate by enclosing each of the data generation function calls in their own try-except blocks?
[Image at https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/6/8/681a3a02c951eaf7014d116d45b9ac35b8fdd2de.png]image302×252 3.45 KB
I think it would be better to enclose each of these function calls in their own try-except blocks. This screenshot is taken from the datagen.py file sent in yesterday’s results mail.
So, will it be possible to re-evaluate my task A1, A8, A9 and A10? At least A9 and A10 did not even get the files to work on as they weren’t even created due to insufficient error handling in datagen.py .
Also, can you help me to identify the cause of even the Pillow default font not being available? I don’t understand how a font not being available could be caused by my code.
Thank you

@carlton then why is the image id different?
in the docker hub as well as my local terminal the image id is 07b16dc68225

**Post ID:** 612890

When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form.
In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours.
But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear.
We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question.

Greetings, Sir,
I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.
To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.
I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.
Thank you for your assistance!

**Post ID:** 613369

Hi,
For Tasks A8, A9 & A10, I am not seeing any errors in my Docker execution logs. I am assuming the evaluation script failed to fetch the output file to verify the output for some reason. Can you please try rerunning these three tasks again? These tasks are working fine for me.
For Task B1. “Data outside /data is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it.” - So when the evaluation asked to write something to /tmp/hello.txt it has correctly thrown an error saying access denied. I think this should be marked as correct. As the task description itself says so, the return is passed as 200 OK
ERROR:main:Error executing write_file: Access denied: /tmp/hello.txt
INFO:     172.17.0.1:60918 - "POST /run?task=Write+%27Hello+World%27+to+%60%2Ftmp%2Fhello.txt%60 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK


Similarly for task B2.
INFO:main:Checking file path: /data/format.md
ERROR:main:Error executing file_folder_deletion: Deletion not allowed: /data/format.md
INFO:     172.17.0.1:59446 - "POST /run?task=Delete+%2Fdata%2Fformat.md HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

For Task B4, if branch is not given we are assuming it as ‘main’ branch. Is it not correct? We would have at least expected the branch passed in the request.
For Task B8, I could not see the task description sent in the request in evaluation log file. Can you please check if the task request was passed properly?
Because I see only “=4 B8 failed: not all arguments converted during string formatting” for Task B8

@Jivraj @carlton
Thanks for your encouragement.. tried debugging the issue of image not starting up in the orchestrator script.. I found that the issue was happening because of the http and https proxies being set in docker build
ARG http_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80
 ARG https_proxy=http://www-proxy-adcq7.us.<xxx>.com:80

ENV http_proxy=${http_proxy}
 ENV https_proxy=${https_proxy}

This was required  as my office environment was behind the proxy and it was required for uv to download the dependencies on startup..
So this had caused the image to run in my office environment and not in orchestrator environment.. now removed the same and tested in a different vm altogether and noticed that the container  started up without issues..
Checkin url: Update Dockerfile removed hard coded proxies · rsjay1976/TDS-Project1-Jan25@a71e3a8 · GitHub
Have pushed the latet image (rsjay1976/tds-project1-jan25:latests) to docker hub as well..  didnt make any source changes or any other changes in the image.. Would be great if this is considered and image be considered for reevaluation… Appreciate your help

on a side note, to validate and test our docker/podman images on a platform outside of our dev environment we can use https://labs.play-with-docker.com/.. this is a free platform to download run and test docker images …

Hi @carlton @Jivraj
I might have found a bug in my code, I have hardcoded my file directory into my code but I didn’t change it later. I have created a safe_open function that will throw a HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN error when tried to access files outside that directory. Because of this all the tasks failed. There also might be environment and configuration issues in my Dockerfile. When I tested locally, it worked fine but because of this small mistake I am now only getting 1/20. Is it possible to change/modify my code?
Thanks for considering, any help would be appreciated. Worked very hard for this

@Jivraj @carlton sir I fixed my issue with docker during the given window for discrepancy and requested a re-pulling of the image but still got a mail of score 0. Please sir, I request you to do a re-evaluation, the docker issue is fixed long back by me. It’s an earnest request sir.

Dear sir,  @carlton @Jivraj
I got result as fail for the project 1 and the reasons listed are as in the screenshot. But as you can see in the second screenshot, i still have that repository which is public, have license file and docker file in it, created 2 months back. I actually don’t know how this issues come in, please resolve this.

Your dockerfile is misspelt.

**Post ID:** 614014

Thanks for your quick response sir. I just wanted to clarify that my dockerfile was recognized by Docker, and my image was successfully built, so it seems that Docker itself didn’t have an issue with the filename.
However, I understand that the evaluation script might be case-sensitive and specifically looking for “Dockerfile” with an uppercase “D”. If that’s the issue, should I rename and push the file again to the repo sir.
Please let me know if that’s the right fix or if I need to do anything else sir.

**Post ID:** 614015

The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form.
But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image.
Kind regards

Hi @Jayeshbansal ,
The docker repo name that you submitted through submission form was different than what your screenshot shows. /jayeshbansal/add9a05689d3 docker repo doesn’t exists or might not be public, that’s why it failed for you.

The task B6 was
https://quotes.toscrape.com/ has quotes from famous people.
The .author class has the quote author’s name.
Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings.
E.g. ["Douglas Adams", "J.K. Rowling", ...]
The output in your file is not an array of double quoted strings.
Instead it is an array of an json object with the keyword author and values as an array of authors.
These are two different things. Almost there but not quite.

@carlton @Jivraj My P1 submission successfully passed all the basic sanity checks on February 15th and obtained a satisfactory score in the P1 evaluation, which was disclosed on March 29th. However, I received a communication today, April 1, stating that my Docker image is not present or public on DockerHub. I kindly request the TDS course team to investigate this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution for students encountering similar issues.
This situation is particularly disheartening—seeing days of effort and dedication to Project 1 reduced to nothing, especially given the already demanding pace of the course.
I will appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

I understand the problem. It may be possible that the image id i gave may be different as i had multiple dockerfile and there is a possibility that i gave the wrong image id due to some confusion.

Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

@Jivraj
Can you also clarify my issue?
My submission meets all the prerequisites according to my Git repository and Docker image. Additionally, I can see the results in the evaluation log.

Standard name of dockerfile is Dockerfile that’s why it didn’t pass Dockerfile check

**Post ID:** 614366

@Jivraj @carlton
I understand sir Dockerfile name was misspelt sir. Since my Docker image was built and recognized, I didn’t realize this would prevent evaluation.
I worked hard on this project sir, and my Docker image was built successfully. Please consider my submission sir.

**Post ID:** 614367

I  have been trying to resolve all the errors but just noticed that my docker image id associated with the project is “c9dc7fbcf405” , meanwhile the mail I received mentions that some other image id was evaluated.
Can you please look into this matter and evaluate the correct Image ID.
Roll number: 23F1001012
@carlton @Jivraj

**Post ID:** 614374

@Jivraj @Carlton I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted.
However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29.
[Image at https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/9/a/9acc2fc47ea84b9e26c1ed21442ba873d0dca20e.png]image1272×395 25.7 KB
But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:*

Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models.
Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc.
Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything.
Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated.
Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up.

All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents, and it would do that for you—without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent.

Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate.
To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29, after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it.
My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0—since it was already evaluated and graded.
Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard @carlton @Jivraj

Actually I got the email as my docker file is not in root git hub repository. But everything thing looks fine and my docker file also runs well.. I want to check my repo again ..sir kindly do my my evaluation again and we have put lot of efforts doing this project 1 . Hope the team evaluated and gives the deserved marks
@carlton
@ TDS TEAM

**Post ID:** 614390

There is no Dockerfile in the root directory of your GitHub repository. The standard naming convention for a Dockerfile is Dockerfile.

**Post ID:** 614402

@carlton @Jivraj please let know if any issues in my end on the docker image not present issue.. As explained in earlier thread , the only reason docker image had to be pushed  was the removal my office proxies in the docker image which was making the container not to startup from orchestration environment.. any help is appreciated..

**Post ID:** 614453

@Jivraj @carlton  I updated google form 4 days ago on the architecture, Could you let me know when it will be re-evaluated ? Thanks

**Post ID:** 614462

Hi @thinkmachine @22f3002723
Since you updated docker repo few days ago and docker api doens’t support timestamp based pulling we will pull your GitHub repo before 18 th feb and will build through it and run evaluations.
We also have your docker repo evaluation score, will discuss which one to keep.
This is for anyone who updated their docker repo and there are around 10-20 such cases

**Post ID:** 614474

Thanks for the understanding @Jivraj

**Post ID:** 614498

Hi @thinkmachine
As we said before that changes in Docker image after deadline won’t be accepted. Even an extension of the deadline won’t help in this case, simply because Docker API doesn’t support timestamp based pulling. However we would be pulling your GitHub repositories before 18th Feb build a Docker container and run evaluations on that.

**Post ID:** 614499

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini request your help in clarification for the same, the Github repo has been always present but it is marking it as fail. Thank you

**Post ID:** 614504

A sigh of relief! Thank you so much for the heads up @Jivraj.
@Saransh_Saini Yup! The Docker issue is perfectly understandable. Even I checked my Hub repo, and I couldn’t seem to find an image having the pre-18th Feb digest. Had I been aware of this issue, and the fact that a re-eval would be carried out, I would’ve tagged the updated image differently. Hopefully, cases like mine will aid in resolving any issues in the future.
Once again, thank you both!

**Post ID:** 614596

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini
I am still uncertain as to why I received a second email regarding my project 1 score, indicating a failure due to unmet pre-requisites. I have inquired multiple times, yet I have not received a response. Meanwhile, several other posts, both before and after mine, have been addressed. Kindly clarify about that mail.
Thankyou

**Post ID:** 614604

@carlton   Sir pls see my issue

**Post ID:** 614613

I have the same issue. I also received a second mail stating I had failed due to some missing prerequisites though in the first mail my project evaluation had been carried out.

**Post ID:** 614620

Hi @lakshaygarg654
Dont worry you passed pre-requsites. The script that was used earlier for basic checks used a stricter criteria, the newer one we wrote allowed for a looser check. You have scored very well in your latest run. 12 correct tasks.
We have not responded quickly because we are in the midst of finalising all the scores and doing normalisation etc, i.e operational work for Project 1 and 2.
We hope to have Project 2 scores out by this weekend.
Kind regards

**Post ID:** 614623

@carlton @Jivraj
Sir can you also see the case of Dockerfile name. Many students have named it dockerfile , lower case ‘d’ character instead of upper case.
Please sir see through it

**Post ID:** 614624

Thanks @carlton , for your response.
I was never worried about the result, whether it comes late or early. I know you will release it once everything is processed correctly. My concern was only about getting a response. Anyway, thanks for replying.
Also, today’s session has been canceled. I wanted to ask about the issue with editing responses in the Project 2 form. Is there any update on this?

**Post ID:** 614709

Hi just wanted to know, there was no mail prior stating to keep the Dockerfile in the root folder of the repo (correct me if im wrong). Therefore i have put everything inside a folder - wont this be considered? Please clarify if possible.

Can anyone explain what errors of this sort mean?

**Post ID:** 614725

You have to show which task triggered this error. Is it all of them or only one of them. Only then we can diagnose what the problem is.

**Post ID:** 614740

[Image at https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/6/a/6a204d9c51d90a584e4e56d593b24821129e056e_2_519x500.png]10000041901193×1149 136 KB
Here it is with the task, however the error doesn’t seem to be related to the task itself based on the returned message in the JSON. It seems to be something wrong with the OpenAI API key. From the reading I did, it seems that the key was perhaps not set properly during evaluation? Not completely sure but please look into it.

**Post ID:** 614754

Did all tasks produce the same error?

Yes except B1 somehow.

Hi @AryanTikam

Can you pls tell me my project 1 marks
My evaluation.py had 2 score
First one 1/20 where every task showed error second one had 10/20…

Dockerfile has to be insider root directory of github repo.

This was mistake from our end we rectified it and reevaluated your submission.
Your submission has a good score.

**Post ID:** 614790

swati-iitm/project1_final
This is your github repo which doesn’t have a Dockerfile. That’s why It didn’t pass Prechecks

**Post ID:** 614792

We have reevaluated it, we have scores avaliable for your submission.

**Post ID:** 614796

Sir I understand you will be busy evaluating all the files and reevaluating them as well. I just wanted to know if its a confirm 0 for those who got evaluation log file MISSING and didnt get the other mail that many got in the past 2 days… Just to confirm… cause i think am getting 0 from that @carlton @Jivraj

**Post ID:** 614804

So can anything be done about it now as it seems to pass more tasks without the proxy requirement? It is fine if not.

**Post ID:** 614814

Please, can you put a screenshot of where it has been communicated, prior to the deadline.

**Post ID:** 614825

We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it.
We discussed it internally with @s.anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise.
In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by @s.anand
So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.
Kind regards,
TDS team

**Post ID:** 614834

@carlton Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score.
I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again.
Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor.
Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

Hi Prashant,
Your prerequisites have passed and your evaluation is 6 tasks have been completed successfully. The email was auto sent because we were doing some checks with an older, stricter script. The newer script passes your evaluation.
Kind regards

**Post ID:** 614838

Thanks for the quick reply, i don’t have a convincing argument to counter. Just a suggestion it would have been better if you have explicitly put in the sanity check requirements. Something so obvious to you might not be so for others.
if you are referring to this email even here, it was not explicit. Might have missed it in the gmeet. A mail would have been good.

We are rebuilding all docker submissions from github commit before 18th of Feb, using your Dockerfile manifest present in the repo.

No. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.

**Post ID:** 614927

Ok… I do have a doubt tho, i actually have app.py and main.py in my github, my main.py is running on 8000 and app.py on 5000 …

**Post ID:** 614930

but in Dockerfile in your github repo you didn’t run main.py,

**Post ID:** 614932

In your Dockerfile you didn’t copy taskA.py to the container.

Ouch, ok sir… hopefully project 2 doesnt disappoint

It is there in the master branch of the repository. Now, will the previous evaluation mail that we got be considered or this one?

@carlton @Jivraj
I recently received an email with an evaluation file for Project 1, which included a score. However, in the recent email, I noticed that my score was recorded as zero, despite fulfilling all the prerequisites.
I kindly request a re-evaluation of my project, as I believe this may be an error.

@Jivraj @carlton
Sir,
In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many students.

I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it?
After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases passed.

**Post ID:** 615131

This is a common mistake many, many students made. They created a working application but not a working container.

You only copied app.py into your docker image.
How do you expect your application to run without the other files that your repo clearly shows is needed?
Thats why many people are failing this. Hope the image makes this clear.

I am getting license not present at root of github repo but i have the license added could someone please explain why ?

**Post ID:** 615138

@thinkmachine
Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. 
However with regards to your long post…
Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a very experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him.
What you have done is what is called in industry as gold plating. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec.
In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why?

Because it does not deliver what was required,
Wastes valuable time and resources
Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!)
Complicates testing
Leads to scope creep

His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate.
I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out.
For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).
Kindest regards

Hi Sir,
I just realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag “abhay227/version1” instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is 4db729a03f74 , which is part of version1 that is already present and publicly available.
I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this error, my whole effort may be wasted. Unfortunately, I did not receive any notification regarding an invalid submission after I submitted the Project1 form, and I only recently became aware of this mistake. I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.
Thank you for your understanding and assistance. I look forward to your positive response.

Hi Abhay,
This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.
Kind regards

Hi sir, hope you are doing well.
Could you please check and let me know if I have passed the project 1 and if yes then how much am I scoring in Project 1 after the latest evaluation?

**Post ID:** 615386

Thanks for the clarification regarding the evaluation, @carlton. It’s a relief to know that my original submission was successfully evaluated. Had I known that the stricter evaluation script would pull the image matching the digest from the time of submission (which had been overwritten by April 1), I would’ve used a separate tag to avoid the issue altogether.
Regarding your point on gold plating — I completely understand and have come to appreciate the importance of building to spec from personal experience, especially in production or client-facing settings where fixed targets, maintainability, and minimal scope creep are key. That said, with TDS projects, my goal was purely exploratory — to explore the boundaries of what’s possible within the scope of the problem statement.
What began as just another (pun intended) tedious assignment slowly evolved into a hobbyist research project on LLM agents. 
(…caution: long post ahead )
I noticed that test cases in Project 1 and 2 were highly specific and often overlapping on Python & Shell use. While it would’ve been easy to hardcode 50+ Python functions to pass these cases (which, frankly, many of us were doing), it is non-scalable at best. I quickly realized that stochastic parrots + hardcoded functions were a recipe for disaster, especially considering the inherent randomness in LLM-generated payloads. No two payloads are exactly alike — even minor differences, like an absolute vs relative file path, or some hidden edge case could cause a hardcoded solution to fail unpredictably. There’s also really no way to predict an edge case caused by an LLM.
Some might suggest using temperature=0 to get more deterministic LLM behavior — and while true to an extent, it does little to encourage exploration, especially in tasks that require self-correction based on environmental feedback. Prompt engineering too wouldn’t be helpful here as 4o-mini isn’t all that great at 0-shot instruction following, especially when the system prompt is already saturated with 50+ fine-grained instructions. There’s only so much stuff it can pay attention to.
Hardcoded tool agents also aren’t really “agents” in my view— they’re more like passive AI powered regex matchers: merely mapping inputs to functions by inferring from context window. That puts all the burden of answering on the hardcoded functions, leaving the agent itself uninvolved in the solutioning process. If they break, the agent will never try to ‘fix’ them and keep calling them like a broken record.
At the core of it, it’s all about how much flexibility vs rigidity we give to the agent. Fully rigid solutions (e.g. hardcoding) overfit and break easily; fully flexible ones (e.g. pure LLM based) hallucinate or drift off-target. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between — The right solution would naturally balance the lesser of two evils in an ideal ratio.
Since most LLMs already excel at code generation and structured solutioning, the most effective strategy that I figured out for the agent was to,

Reason about the task, understand intent,
Reflect, whether this problem is solvable using available tools without human intervention and design structured workflows, in whatever order appropriate (i.e. design a DAG, where each node can be a python step or a shell step or something else)
Execute those workflows (walk the DAG) observing the feedback at each step and reiterating if needed.
Observe the final result, and repeat if needed.

Interestingly, a similar framework was suggested in this ICLR 2022 paper. That was all the validation I needed to know I was stepping in the right direction.
To make environment interaction possible, the agent didn’t need dozens of narrow tools — just a small, well-defined set of general-purpose tools:

A REPL executor (for quick calcs)
A Python script runner
A Shell executor

With just these, it could handle most tasks flexibly and naturally — avoiding overengineering while still enabling powerful behaviors. Potentially allowing for full fledged Computer-Use via shell and so much more.
As for the fact that it ended up being capable of things beyond the scope of Project 1 (like training & tuning ML models autonomously, reporting results etc.) — that was emergent behavior, not deliberate gold plating. It was a pleasant surprise even to me. I’ve yet to discover more of such interesting hidden use cases. While some might naturally call it scope creeping (and yes that is true, given that we had a deadline, and a play-pretend client-business relationship with the course team), I saw it as an opportunity for exploration and research. Frankly, I AM personally very keen about researching stuff!
I am actually very thankful to the TDS course team & @s.anand for devising such a thoughtful project that sparked some interesting ideas that I can tinker with. Food for thought! Really!
As for my next project, I now have a fair idea of what I’ll be experimenting with— modalities.
PS: I’m not claiming it’s perfect or production-ready, or it should score a perfect 22/20, but it aligned well with what I believe was the spirit of these projects: thoughtful use of LLMs in agent design. At this point, I’m less concerned about the marks, I’m actually enjoying the thought joyride. 

TL;DR
My approach doesn’t rely on regex or hardcoded mappings. Instead, it passes user input directly to an LLM, which then plans and executes workflows using general tools inside a containerized environment. It also learns from feedback and iterates — much like a human. The fact that it can do more than just the minimum spec is a byproduct of that framework. I’ve only just wired the pieces together.
Kind regards

Request for Clarification on Zero Marks Given – Repository Was Public with All Required Files
Dear @Carlton sir
I wanted to kindly request a clarification regarding the evaluation of my project submission. I noticed that I have been awarded zero marks, and I’m a bit confused because I had made sure that everything was in place.

My GitHub repository was public at the time of submission.
I had included the Dockerfile as required.
I also added the MIT License to the project.
For your reference, I am also attaching a snapshot of the repository as it was during the submission time.

Given all these were in place, I would really appreciate it if you could provide a concrete reason for giving zero marks. I’m eager to understand what went wrong so I can avoid it in the future and improve myself. But u saying in email that my repo was not public , not having dockerfile and not having mit licsence .

Hi sir
I noticed a discrepancy in my Project 1 results. In the initial results shared on March 29th, I had received 8/20 based on the evaluation logs. However, the final result I received today states that none of the tasks in Task A and B were working, and I was awarded only 1 bonus mark.
During my own testing, I was consistently getting 7/10 correct in Task A, so I’m a bit confused about the change.
Kindly request you to look into this discrepancy sir
Thank you

Dear @carlton Sir,
I was getting 8 marks in your evaluation but today I checked the mail, I was awarded 0 marks. I am not sure what happened. Everything was in place. I would really appreciate if you can provide a reason for zero marks. I rechecked everything and looks good. Awaiting your reply. Thanks.

Dear @carlton Sir,
I’ve noticed discrepancies in my Project 1 results. During the tests I ran before submitting, I consistently got about 7/10 in Task A. In the results shared earlier, I was informed that my evaluation log file was missing. Later, a Gform regarding the architecture was sent, which I filled and submitted. Now, the final result I received today, shows that the taskA module is missing and I’ve been given a bonus of 1 mark.
I kindly request you to look into the matter and provide an explanation and solution in this regard.
Thank you.

Respected Sir,
I hope you’re all doing well. I’m writing regarding my Project 1 evaluation, as I’ve encountered a discrepancy that I’d like some help with.
According to the evaluation email I received, my score was 0 for all the tasks with an additional bonus of 1 (totaling a P1 score of 1). However, when I ran the provided evaluation script before my submission, I got 7 in Phase A. Additionally, after reviewing the Docker logs, evaluation logs, and the p1_evaluation_error_logs (from the linked Google Sheets), I couldn’t find any reference to my roll number.
Could someone please help me investigate this issue? I’d really appreciate any guidance from the evaluation team.
Thank you for your time and assistance!

@carlton i am sure i had cleared 8/10 test cases in part A of the project despite rigrous checking and no error was found my be but still i have been alloted 0 in all the cases , this is no small issue as project holds a significant amount of weightage in the end term
I had spent hours finishing my project and this i am sure my marks are not on par with the desired work i did
Look into this matter as it signifies if i will be able yo pass tds in this term or not.

But in email u said n , your repo was not public, even not had dockerfile nor mit licence that’s what I mentioned.

Your repo is not public! Thats why we cannot see any other files either. If its not public we cannot see if other files exist. We cannot evaluate an invisible repo.

My repo is public even before it was. How can I set to public..thisis same n while creating new repo u just select the public and not private that’s it n.

You have to replicate this test environment for testing.




Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science


    To replicate the test environment: 
git clone <your repo url> 
cd <your repo directory> 
docker build -t <your image name> 
Run new docker image using 
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -P 8000:8000 <your image name> 
Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder 
uv run evaluate.py --email=<any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 
This then re-produces the exact environment how your application was  tested. 
You have to provide a token from your environment for testing.

Please replicate this first. We also run it on a linux server.

Things i have done for my project to work locally:



 carlton:

git clone <your repo url>


cloned my repo which looked like this after cloning(ignore those green dots)

All the files are  in this folder (I wasn’t aware that we cannot have the subfolder in the root directory,I shouldn’t get penalized for this) and added the datagen and evaluate.py file.



 carlton:

Keep datagen.py and evaluate.py in same folder


when i do this( ) i get this error



 carlton:

docker build -t <your image name>


PS D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1> docker build -t "tushar2k5/tds-project-1"                                                                 
ERROR: "docker buildx build" requires exactly 1 argument.
See 'docker buildx build --help'.

Usage:  docker buildx build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -

Start a build

Instead,in order to run the docker image successfully  we have to do either of the two things(taken help from chatgpt ):
1)
Use full path (recommended if you're outside the project folder):

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 D:\TDS_Project_1\tds-project-1

OR
2)
Add a dot (.) at the end to specify the current directory as the build context:

docker build -t tushar2k5/tds-project-1 .

Both the things work for me()



 carlton:

docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -P 8000:8000 <your image name>


docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=i.am.still.noob.inTDS -p 8000:8000 tushar2k5/tds-project-1

Done this(can’t leak my token,already many students stolen it from my project-2🤦‍♂️)



 carlton:

uv run evaluate.py --email=<any email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000


uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2003751@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

Dockerfile has to be inside root of any github repo, this is standard and we had discussion with Professor Anand about such cases where it’s not part of root directory, he suggested we will consider only Dockerfile being present in root folder of the repo.

Sorry but its not possible to attend every single session and you guys haven’t informed us via email so how its our fault.For cases like this you guys should allow us to move our files to the root directory so it can work…(we just have to move files  in the repo please consider it)@carlton @Saransh_Saini @s.anand

Please do consider allowing us to change the position of the dockerfile to the root. We are doing nothing but changing its location in the repo. This was not mentioned anywhere in the prerequisites before the submission and it is unfair to not consider all our work for a criteria that was nowhere mentioned in the course page before the submissions. It may be standard practice but a lot of us were unaware. Please do consider this request.

Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.”
If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page?
We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!!
Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.
In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.

@carlton @Jivraj
Dear Sir,
I got log with error as /bin/sh: 1: [/root/.local/bin/uv,: not found.
I debugged that I had a small issue in the dockerfile that was submitted and it is
CMD [“/root/.local/bin/uv”, “run”, “app.py”]  has an invisible Unicode non-breaking space (U+00A0) between "run", "app.py" instead of a regular space. This causes the shell to misread the command.
I know it’s very late for the submission to reconsider, but this small mistake spoiled my hard earned project which got local score 8/25 which could finally get converted to 12 marks. I made this change and pushed it to docker and github repository. Considering this, I request you to please evaluate my submission if possible, because I don’t want to lose the marks which i tried my level best to score. I already have good score in GA’s and ROE.  Expecting a positive response from your end.

Sir, I realized that I mistakenly submitted the image tag "abhay227/version1" instead of the correct image ID. The correct image ID is 4db729a03f74, which is part of version1 and is already present and publicly available.
Unfortunately, I didn’t receive any notification about this issue after submission. Receiving this mail at this stage feels disheartening after all the effort I’ve put into the project.  I kindly request you please consider this correct image ID.

@carlton and @Jivraj , for Task A i had tested before and all the test cases passed, but all my A tasks has failed with 0, In the evaluation logs, i could see that all task A tests failed due to datagen.py not available.
Could you rerun the test ?

**Post ID:** 616168

Respected Sir,
Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment.
Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment
I cloned my repository using:
bash
git clone <my_repo_url>
cd <my_repo_directory>
I built the Docker image using:

bash
docker build -t.
I ran the Docker container with:

bash
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000

I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed.

Finally, I ran the evaluation script using:

bash
uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

Issue with Original Submission
After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally.
However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail.
I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message.
Action Taken
To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected:
The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes.
It responds to requests within the required timeframe.
I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository:
Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest
Request for Re-Evaluation
I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly.
Previous Message for Reference
For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail:
"Greetings, Sir,
I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well.
To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe.
I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again.
Thank you for your assistance!"

There are no evaluation logs for you, I am not sure which evaluation log you are referring to. Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query?




Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science


    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that 
import requests
import pandas 
DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")

url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"

        for commit in commits:

Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.
You must replicate the test environment and then if you submission works, you have a legitimate appeal. Otherwise we will not consider it. Please replicate the issue using the test environment as detailed in the post link.

You can take it up with @s.anand
I did not come up with the standard.
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in.

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol.

MOST importantly mail shows :
Your final t score calculation is based on
MIN (20, (task score + bonus))
Github repo submitted: GitHub - 23f2001390/llmagent
Docker repo submitted: 23f2001390/llmagent
Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 1
Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1
Your task score is: 0
Your bonus is: 1
Your P1 score is: 1

So according to the above, I passed the pre-requisites and also in mail u have mentioned that:
We have attached the docker logs and the evaluation logs for everyone who passed the pre-requisites.
but I don’t find my mail id or roll number in the docker_logs.zip or evaluation_logs.zip  that has been given in the mail(latest), if I passed the pre requisites my logs should be there in the zip files included in this latest mail right, my roll number is 23f2001390 and email id is 23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
and nor do i find my id in the p1_evaluation_error_logs so please help sir

Hi Hari,
Your docker failed to build.
Did you try to replicate the test environment as mentioned in




Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science


    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that 
import requests
import pandas 
DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp("2025-02-18", tz="Asia/Kolkata")

url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits"
try : 
    response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60)
    fetch_commit = None
    if response.status_code == 200:
        commits = response.json()
        for commit in commits:
            sha = commit["sha"]
   …
  

If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs.
90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo.
The specific error in your case is:
tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists
Thats why there are no logs.

We cannot allow changes to repos. This is a blanket rule for everyone. No exceptions. Since the only way to get your project to work is to make changes to it, we cannot score you for changes.

Thanks for the response. We can go on endless discussions using “nice words” “professionally” with the number of questions we have. Finally we are at the receiving end as students in this setup.

What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems.

Hi I have my Dockerfile saved as dockerfile, given 0 for project 1 due to this. This doesn’t seem to be a big issue to grade me 0 for this. Kindly correct the score please.

Most common reason for during running docker image was taskA module was missing which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with building and running image, if they would have done that they could have corrected it at early stage.

Sir actually my project doesn’t have requirements.txt, instead it installs automatically
when:
uv run app.py is run and for docker image it installs while building and I had submitted the docker image with all libraries required(the dockerfile below, in that it installs while building).
my dockerfile from the repo:
FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates

# Download and install uv
ADD https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh /uv-installer.sh
RUN sh /uv-installer.sh && rm /uv-installer.sh

# Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn requests python-dateutil pandas db-sqlite3 scipy pybase64 python-dotenv httpx markdown duckdb faker pillow

# Ensure the installed binary is on the `PATH`
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Set up the application directory
WORKDIR /app
# Copy application files
COPY *.py /app/
COPY .env /app/

# Explicitly set the correct binary path and use `sh -c`
CMD ["/root/.local/bin/uv", "run", "app.py"]

here u can see it installs using pip install …
here it’s requiring .env file to be present in the project folder because my project when I was uploading to both git and docker had .env file for AIPROXY_TOKEN and I uploaded to docker with that .env file but as git doesn’t allow upload of .env file I couldn’t upload.env to git
the project will still work after downloading the repository when we upload AIPROXY_TOKEN as environment variable but to again build the docker image for replicating the test environment, my docker image could not be built because.env file doesn’t upload to GIT, so when I downloaded the repository from the above method, it didn’t have the .env file so it didn’t build so I had to create the .env file now to create the docker image, and for the dockerimage I had submitted, I built it with the .env file(it supports both.env file and environment variable one)

    You can take it up with @s.anand 
I did not come up with the standard. 
And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files. 

Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in. 

Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand i…

Latest one was done through github repo, if code in github repo is not consistent with docker image it might cause problems.

**Post ID:** 616354

@carlton @jivraj sir it is my humble request to do something. We are losing our marks because of small negligence or mistakes like i fogot to commit my requirements.txt in my github repository. Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.

Sir, how my git repo is not consistent i used the same repo which i have given you in the form even i did not commit any changes after 18th feb also in my docker file there is just a simple mistake that i forgot to add flask dependency just because of that mistake i am losing my marks. I also used same docker image which i have given you through form. Its my humble request please consider or give some solution. It felt like betrayal because we put effort’s.

**Post ID:** 616388

Dear Sir,
I understand that this request is coming at a late stage, and I truly apologize for the timing. However, I felt it was important to express how much effort and dedication I have invested in this project and throughout the course. The recent issue has been disheartening for me, especially because the work I submitted was not a blind copy from someone else.
Had it been otherwise, I wouldn’t have had the courage to reach out. I genuinely care about this course and the learning it offers, and I’m proud of the commitment I’ve shown so far.
With utmost respect, I kindly request you to reconsider evaluating my project again, if there’s any possible way to do so. It would mean a lot to me and would really motivate me to keep pushing forward in this subject.

**Post ID:** 616396

Hi @23f1001524 @afsalshah @23f1000879 @23f1002056
I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless.
We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure.
A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working.
Critical failures prevents everything else from working and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures.
I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career.
Kindest regards

**Post ID:** 616511

@carlton @jivraj @s.anand,
I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to humbly request a reconsideration regarding the evaluation of my project submission.
I understand there was an issue with building the Docker image from the repository. However, I had successfully built and pushed the Docker image earlier, and I believe it demonstrates that my solution is deployable. If the final evaluation was solely based on building from the repository, I’m a bit confused about why the Docker image was considered earlier and why we were also asked to upload it to Docker Hub if it wasn’t going to be taken into account later. Also the earlier evaluation score where we got some marks at least and now are hopes are crushed after one night.
I do realize that in the real world, these kinds of errors can be critical, and I truly appreciate that the course is structured to prepare us for such expectations. That said, this course has been quite challenging, and for many students—including myself—it has been a source of considerable stress and demotivation.
I sincerely request that you kindly consider awarding some partial marks for the working Docker image that was built and pushed earlier. It does reflect an understanding of deployable solutions, which I’ve worked hard to demonstrate.
I know you all have our best interests in mind, and I’m grateful for the efforts put into making this a rigorous and enriching course. My only concern is that such harsh penalties—especially for a single oversight—can significantly affect our CGPA and future opportunities. I hope my request can be considered with empathy.
Thank you for your time and understanding.

**Post ID:** 616519

**Post ID:** 616523

Sir, I sincerely apologize for the mistake I made in naming the LICENSE file as “LIcense” instead of “LICENSE”. I now understand how important these details are, and it was an unintentional oversight on my part. I had put in a lot of hard work into the project, and it would mean a lot to me if you could kindly consider evaluating it, even though the deadline has passed and results are out. I completely understand if it’s not possible, but I just wanted to request a chance as this project was very important to me and I genuinely learned a lot from it.

Dear @carlton
This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the
/app/app/main.py     file is missing. However, in my project directory, the
main.py   file is located in the   app/   folder, and the   run.py   file is in the root folder of the project, which is   LLM_Automation_Agent  . This structure allows the run.py file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from app/main.py.
To run the project, the command I used is:
python run.py

Since run.py is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to app/main.py.
I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the run.py script located in the root folder (llm-automation-agent).
For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot.
Here is the GitHub link to my project:

I am facing Npx error... can I know what went wrong?



This npx error is originating from your Docker container—it’s not being generated by our script. Try to look for what caused this error.

Oh I see what happened, the image names are different, I don’t know how, given I pushed the latest at 11:51pm and submitted the form at 11:59pm. Thank You @Jivraj for showing me.
Question: Now that I know. how can I test the container myself, if I want to do exactly what you guys are doing?

**Post ID:** 616718

My code uses npx to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via subprocess.run(["npx", "prettier@3.4.2", "--write", ...]), which assumes that npx is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or npx, this results in an error during evaluation.
To test the functionality correctly, npx must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using:
bash: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm
Once installed, npx prettier@3.4.2 should work as expected.
For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where npx is available by default.

Before the project evaluation, I ran the test script and successfully passed all Task A and Task B checks. I also built the Docker image as required.
But, when you gus evaluated , I get the following error:docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: “uvicorn”: executable file not found in $PATH: unknown.
Could you please help me understand why this is happening even though the evaluation script ran fine?

I know in industry level it matters much but right now we are students and for us CGPA matters. i am also uploading his docker file image and mine with 0 commits after 18th feb.

Dear Sirs,
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini @carlton
As per the Project 1 deliverables, I had submitted my Docker Hub repo, that hosted the Docker image. At the time of submission, the image was running smoothly, was fully accessible, and was successfully handling the API calls as intended.
[Image at https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/7/b/7b8a704d618edd74036a95649a83054e29932879.png]Screenshot 2025-04-07 233513805×197 9.52 KB
Github repo submitted: GitHub - wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent
Docker repo submitted: wasimansariiitm/my-ai-agent
The previous evaluation was successfully conducted using my Docker image, which was responding as expected. However, during the subsequent evaluation, the image was rebuilt using my GitHub repo link, and unfortunately, the app.py file could not be found. As a result, my evaluation logs are missing from the evaluation logs bundle.
I would like to respectfully bring this to your kind attention that the app.py file does exist in the repository, but it is located inside a subfolder:
https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent/app/app.py.
But as per the submission instructions, I provided the GitHub repo link only: https://github.com/wasimansari-iitm/Project-AI-Agent.
Humbly stating, I did not anticipate that the image will be rebuilt from the GitHub repo at a later stage due to some unforeseen circumstances. Had I known this, I would have made sure the project repo was structured appropriately to support that scenario. To be noted, that the earlier evaluation ran smoothly, and the app responded to all queries as expected.
I’m unsure what to expect now or request, but I just wanted to bring this issue to your notice. Even if I manage to get a single answer correct upon a successful evaluation, it would mean a lot to me and contribute meaningfully to my overall score. I would be extremely grateful if you could look into my case and extend your support in this matter.
Thank You and Regards,

Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10.
[Image at https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/4/a49f182e22015df35039be85cdd26ad71a07f7a3.png]image1298×857 29.4 KB
I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow.
Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/…
But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements.
Edit 2:
Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking.
[Image at https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/5/f/5f99c9908823f381a7756ba6fe89d4827ca2faf4.png]image1027×510 11 KB
Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.
Thank you.

Shivaditya

This is because if you look at your Dockerfile .env does not exist in your repo.
Therefore it does not build.
Your docker is supposed to take the AIPROXY token from our environment not from yours.
This is passed dynamically at runtime of the Docker.
Since it fails to build, we cannot evaluate it.
Kind regards

docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: exec: "uv": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown

Thats why we cannot evaluate it.

There is clearly some difference between both the applications. That is up to you to figure out. I can only tell whats wrong with yours. After building it and trying to run it this is the error we get. It fails to run as a result and we cannot evaluate it.

We used some internal parameters with weights to auto calculate the bonus. Unless your submission met that threshold of 0.5 after scaling you would not get any bonus. Your score was normalised so instead of 3 you got 4 (3.75 got rounded up). But the metrics used to evaluate the quality of your submission only scored you at 0.007 which is far below the threshold required to get a bonus.

Respected Sir,

Yes Sir, I said the same,  .env was not able to be uploaded to repo as .env file was not allowed to be uploaded
when we download the repository it doesn’t have the .env file,
for docker image to build we need to add .env with AIPROXY_TOKEN
after that docker image will build, I had given about this in previous message
As you said Sir that you will use separate AIPROXY_TOKEN…you can put that in .env file and build the docker image
after that Sir its optional to pass AIPROXY_TOKEN again while running the docker Image
just the .env file required, even without token in that it will work as project has support for both AIPROXY token in .env file and as environment variable

and when I uploaded to repository the .env file was not allowed to upload so had submitted that way, I actually forgot to add step for running the docker image in the previous message, the steps which I used:
git clone https://github.com/23f2001390/llmagent.git

adding .env with AIPROXY token and replacing evaluate.py and datagen.py with new ones according to test environment
docker build -t llm-agent .

docker run -p 8000:8000 llm-agent
or
docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=token -p 8000:8000 llm-agent

and in another terminal
uv run evaluate.py --email=23f2001390@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000

Thank you

Thanks @carlton @Jivraj
As mentioned earlier, the pre Feb 18 dockerFile commited in GIT had  my office proxy url’s set as http_proxy and https_proxy.. It worked in my office envuironment and i tested everything in my office environment but based on the results which came on March last week realised that the proxies were preventing the uv to be installed in other environments.
Post that realised we have cloud based "docker playground’ utility where docker builds can be tested agonistic of any environment.. The good thing with playground is our instances last for only 3 hrs and next day we try we are kind of gauranteed of fresh environment without any caches,
Now after March 30th checkin validated the same in docker playground and ensured that the image got tagged and createdd successfully..
It would be great if the March 30th checkin could be considered, Again appreciate all your help so far.

@carlton
Thank you for the reply .But it was working when i ran the initial evalaute.py .If you don’t  mind could you tell what may have caused this to happen.

Hi Hilal,
You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post




Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science


    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv. 
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
# ]
# ///

import requests
import datetime as dt
import zoneinfo
import argparse
import os
import zipfile

parser = argparse.…
  

That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring.
The specific error itself means:
Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container.
If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work.
Kind regards

sir for my project 1 i got a mail stating that the docker file isn’t public and that’s why prerequisite failed. but i checked it and it seemed absolutely perfect to me. Please look into this issue as my docker repo is public and absolutely as per the requirement.  @carlton @Jivraj

Hi @22f3003083
Following was your submission, which is not a valid dockerrepo.

Now I feel so good getting 0.
0 is best.

@carlton @Jivraj
As requested earlier, Could you please reevaluate my submission.  The only change that had to be done post Feb 18 checkin was to remove my office proxies on Mar 30 from the docker file  to make it work in all environments.. It  would be great if this could be accomodated..

Hi Jayaram,
Unfortunately, we are not able to relax restrictions on changes to your repo, regardless of the reason. We have kept this rule uniform for everyone. If we allow this change, then everyone has a legitimate reason to request changes and would make the rule meaningless because then everyone will be able to make corrections to their submission. We do not even allow spelling changes.
Kind regards

Thanks for the response @carlton ..  just a small suggestion, to avoid scenarios like what i faced and also with softwares like docker/podman not being too windows friendly, i think students can find it easier if a dev/mock  linux env is provided for course term duration, instead of   everyone having to figuring out with AWS/Azure and all providers.. Anyway thanks and appreciate all the help

Sir, could you please check it once more? I think the issue has been resolved. @carlton @Jivraj

**Post ID:** 618231

Since repo was not public during evaluation, we won’t be rechecking, or reevaluating.

**Post ID:** 618301

@Jivraj I’ve completed all the required steps, but I’m still getting 0, It was working fine before. Could you please help me identify what might be going wrong?

**Post ID:** 618314

Hi @21f3003107
You need to look it up yourself, We have sent out evaluation log and docker log files, check those out.
Evaluation script and other scripts that we have used are there in github repository over here.

@carlton Requested sir
This is to request that in my evaluation a got 0 cause of the use of lowercase d instead of uppercase D but I have already submitted the  docker file in my git hub repo also.

@carlton
Thank you i found my mistake in my docker file i wrote  this  CMD [“uv”, “run”, “app.py”]  instead of
CMD [“uvicorn”, “main:app”, “–host”, “0.0.0.0”, “–port”, “8000”].Now i think everything works fine

**Post ID:** 618965

Sir my repo was public

**Post ID:** 618997

Sir any news on this? Did my score increase at all? My dashboard still shows the old score.

**Post ID:** 619160

@carlton sir, my project 1 marks have still not increased even though while during evaluation it shows 4/10 for the task 1. It was said that the docker image prerequisite will be removed and without that the evaluation would be done, but there is still no change in my marks. please look into it once, as my dashboard currently reflects 0 for project 1.

**Post ID:** 619360

These evals are being handled separately. They have not yet been completed. Kindly bear with us till they are complete.

**Post ID:** 619619

Same here @carlton in my evaluation logs i have scored 10 while marks being reflected are not the same neither on mail nor on site

**Post ID:** 619655

I looked at your evaluation logs and it says 1 score instead of 10.

**Post ID:** 620018

Good evening!
1000092114|690x198
I am writing to you to request you please relook into the evaluation.
The docker image which I share is working at my end.  The size of the image is 6 GB which may take more than 5 minutes to load as I wasn’t aware of the infra level restrictions.
I request you to kindly consider my request and please re-evaluate the assignment as I have contributed a lot of effort into it.
Thanks,
Garima

**Post ID:** 620556

Sir, so will my score get updated because now it is marked as 0.

**Post ID:** 620587

@carlton @Jivraj
Sir,
I am Saksham Umate and my project 1 was to be re-evaluation because of docker file not found in root ,but it was their so you had given me confirmation that it will re-evaluate after end term. I had already shared my docker file systems configuration at docker hub
So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it
Tell me if any information is needed about project from my side
Thank you!
Best regards,
Saksham

    Subject: Request for Verification of Dockerfile and Reevaluation of Marks for Project 1 
@carlton @Jivraj 
Sir, 
Regarding the recent feedback on Project 1 for TDS, it was mentioned that there is no Dockerfile in my GitHub repo. However, the Dockerfile is named dockerfile (not Dockerfile). Please verify the repository again with this in mind. 
Additionally, my Docker image architecture is linux/amd64 (64-bit x86). I have also filled out the Architecture Information Collector form as requested.

Evaluations are done for such cases where Dockerfile(with name of Dockerfile as Dockerfile) was present inside other folders than root folder of your github repo.

**Post ID:** 620595

@carlton sir, any info on outcome of this bug in P1 datagen.py ?

**Post ID:** 620608

Did Mark’s are updated or being update for this students ?

**Post ID:** 620628

Hi @22f3000819
We had updated datagen.py(try block for task) which affected 30 students, but scores changed only for 4 students, for others it remained the same.

**Post ID:** 620630

We will be pushing marks today.

**Post ID:** 620636

I probably wasn’t 1 of the 4, right? Anyways thanks for paying attention to the matter.

@carlton @Jivraj
Respected Sir,
I hope you are doing well.
This is with reference to your confirmation mail that my project 1 will be re-evaluated after end term
I would like to sincerely apologize for the oversight in my Project 1 submission. Upon reviewing my GitHub repository, I realized that the file was named dockerfile (with a lowercase ‘d’) in the Github root repo instead of the required Dockerfile (with an uppercase ‘D’).
While the contents of the file were correct and my project passed several evaluation tests, I understand that the evaluation script could not detect the Dockerfile due to this naming issue. I genuinely did not intend to deviate from the standard, and I now fully understand the importance of following naming conventions precisely.
I humbly request you to kindly consider this as an honest mistake and allow a one-time exception, Please sir. This issue has unfortunately resulted in my project score being reduced to 0, which puts my overall course performance at risk. I assure you that I have learned from this experience and such an error will not occur again in the future.
So, I hope you will look at this and re-evaluate my project as I put lots of efforts to complete it.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
Warm regards,
S. Sharmile

Sir, my marks still did not get updated, please help me in that regard.

**Post ID:** 621117

Hi Everyone,
We have sent the updated marks to Operations. At this time of the term they are very busy with lots of updates, so it will take time for them to push it to the dashboard. As soon as they inform us that the scores have been pushed, we will send out a discrepancy form if you find any issues with your score.
Thanks & Kind regards

**Post ID:** 621247

Sir, my project 1 marks are still 0 even though I had passsd few cases. Please help me sir as my final score is coming as 69.8 , it will be very valuable for me if it crosses 70, please sir help me with this regard

@carlton
Hi Sir,
I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to let you know that I put a lot of effort into completing Project1, but I accidentally named the Dockerfile as dockerfile (with a lowercase ‘d’).
Could you please consider evaluating it with that name? I’d really appreciate it.
Thank you!
