```Image was here: A macOS terminal window, operating within a `myenv` Python virtual environment from the `/Users/macbookair/test/test_project` directory, displays the output of a `pytest` test run. The command `python -m pytest test_file.py` was executed. The pytest session, running version 7.2.0 with Python 3.10.8 and `pluggy-1.0.0`, reports "1 item collected" from `test_file.py`, which resulted in a "FAILURE" for the test function `test_login_success`. The detailed traceback highlights a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, specifically an `HTTPConnectionPool` error to `http://localhost:5000/login` because "Max retries exceeded". The root cause is identified as `[Errno 61] Connection refused`, indicating that a local web server (likely a Flask application given the common port 5000 and `/login` endpoint) was not running or not accepting connections during the HTTP POST request to a login API endpoint, which included a JSON payload of `{"username": "testuser", "password": "password"}`. The summary confirms "1 failed in 0.04s", indicating the test failed due to network connectivity rather than application logic.```image1141Ã—678 102 KB
