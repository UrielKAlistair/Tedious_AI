Dont worry about seek portal. GA 7 scores will only get pushed once peer reviews are done.
(roughly 3 days before end term).
Kind regards

What is to be done if the student in question has not done a question? We are required to fill an answer in the quantitative part. We can’t leave it blank.

Just put zero there. Since all the quantitative answers are positive.

Hi @carlton sir,
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.
Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?
```Image was here: The image displays a Gmail interface focused on an inbox labeled "peer review." It contains multiple emails related to a review process, notably dated January 2025, with subjects referencing "GA 7 Review" and "GA 7 Peer allocations," indicating they pertain to peer evaluations in an academic or educational context. The content includes file attachments labeled with HTML extensions, specifically "23f3003944.html," "23f3001178.html," and "23f2001738.html" suggesting these are reports or evaluations submitted for review. Each email outlines submission details for peer evaluations, indicating a structured process for grading or assessment. The interface elements hint at organizational features commonly found in email clients, including search functionality and the display of conversation threads.```10000415651280×349 87.7 KB
