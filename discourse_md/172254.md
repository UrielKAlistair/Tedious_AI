“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.”
So I did. 

 Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments 
Yes, I got great marks in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.
But let’s be real…
It was my Labrador who did the actual work 
While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

Solving deployment issues faster than my dev server boots
Writing function calling code like a true GPT whisperer
Fixing LLM bugs that I didn’t even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.
He growled at broken APIs.
I took the credit. 

 Message from the Dog Developer:

“Thank you all for an awesome semester!
I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.
But I am personally offended by one thing…”


“How dare you give bonus marks on Week 7?
I skipped it — just like many — because we were told only best 4 of 7 would count.
I demand justice. And a belly rub.”
– , Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist


 Moral of the story:
Let your pets help with your coursework.
You get the grade. They get the rage.

After fighting so much for GA, ROE, Project 1, and Project 2, my inner animal got hurt and fell asleep — and that’s how I ended up missing GA7. Please don’t hurt him any further.

I know this is obviously a joke but, is there a rule book by any chance ?

I think you feed your dog desi ghee instead of pedigree
