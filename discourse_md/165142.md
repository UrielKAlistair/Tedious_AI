I wanted to seek clarification regarding the deadline for GA2. The latest email received today mentions the deadline as 26th January, whereas an earlier email stated 2nd February, which is also reflected on the dashboard.
Could you please confirm the correct deadline to avoid any confusion?
```Image was here: The image displays an email notification from the address "donot_reply@study.iitm.ac.in" addressed to a mailing list "251_se2002-announce." The message is structured formally, indicating that it’s directed to learners regarding an academic assignment. Specifically, it announces the deadline for the "Week 1 & 2 Graded Assignment," which is set for "26/01/2025 at 23:59 Hrs." The closing signature of the email reads "Warm Regards, IITM BS Team." The email context suggests it is related to an academic platform, possibly associated with the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, emphasizing timely submission for a graded assignment as part of a Software Engineering course or similar academic program.```image1056×289 15.4 KB
