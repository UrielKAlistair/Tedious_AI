```Image was here: The image shows a text-based discussion focused on file manipulation in a coding context, specifically within a task related to moving and renaming files. It provides a downloadable link to a file named `q-move-rename-files.zip`, suggesting the user extract its contents. The instructions highlight using the `mv` command in a Unix-like shell to transfer files from subdirectories into a designated empty folder, followed by a renaming requirement that involves replacing each digit in the filenames sequentially (e.g., transforming a file named `a19b.txt` into `a20b.txt`). Additionally, there is a command line snippet suggesting execution of `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in the bash shell, indicating a focus on generating a checksum hash of the file contents after the specified operations. The context involves shell commands and Unix-based file handling, intended for users with a grasp of command line operations.```image1296×158 7.29 KB
For question 16 of GA1, It says "Rename all files replacing each digit with the next "
Accepted answer is working only if file names are renamed as
2h3q9x.txt → 3h4q0x.txt
eb209nmlca.txt → eb310nmlca.txt
That means if digit is 9 then next digit should be 0. @carlton @Jivraj let me know if this is what is expected. since 9->10 or 209 → 210 is not working

**Post ID:** 575795

Hi anant,
Question mentions every digit should be replaced by next one.
In that case 209 would get replaced by 310

**Post ID:** 575815

Hello Sir, When I am following that logic to rename files, assessment check is giving error “Incorrect. Try again.”

Hi Anant,



 21f2000370:

```Image was here: The image displays a task description labeled "Move and rename files" from a technical forum or educational platform, specifying a coding challenge worth 0.5 marks. Users are instructed to download a ZIP file named `q-move-rename-files.zip`, extract its contents, and utilize the `mv` command in a Unix-like terminal to relocate all files from nested folders into a specified empty folder. The task involves renaming the files such that each digit in the filename is replaced with its successor (for example, transforming `a19b.txt` to `a20b.txt`). Additionally, it queries the output of running the Bash command `grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum` in the context of that folder, implying a focus on understanding file manipulation and command-line operations related to file management, sorting, and hashing. The presence of terminal commands indicates a programming context relevant to shell scripting and file handling.```image1296×158 7.29 KB


Here in question, it’s mentioned to replace every digit with next digit, that’s why 209 would be 310.

Hi manmeet,
I don’t know about solution to this.
Some network setting might be causing problem.
Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.
I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.

2 days ago I  attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions.
When I logged in today it says score is 0.
Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again?
Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links?
If [seek] (Nptel Seekh) can access [TDS exam] (Technical Assessment) then why we need to submit from seek?

**Post ID:** 579142

The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to ```Image was here: The image contains a user interface from a technical forum, prominently featuring a "Save" button in blue, which suggests a focus on saving changes or configurations. Below the button, there may be visible snippets of code, possibly in a programming language like Python or JavaScript, containing function definitions or configuration settings. Additionally, there might be console output or logs that reflect the status of operations, including success messages or error warnings. The presence of YAML or JSON text structures may indicate data configuration or API settings. Elements like file names, which could refer to script files or configuration files, suggest a programming context, possibly related to web development or software configuration management. The overall purpose appears to center around saving code changes, interacting with a software tool or environment, and possibly debugging or configuration tasks. Specific technologies such as web frameworks, API tools, or IDEs may also be implied through the interface design.``` the submissions to get a score for the GA.
The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or
on the Tools in Data Science introduction page.
Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs.
As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. 
We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser.
Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem.
For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly.
Kind regards

**Post ID:** 579152

Thanks @carlton.
I answered questions on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect.
My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)

**Post ID:** 579182

Hi @Nelson
Your answers on the exam site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes).
Kind regards

It might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute data-value. There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute data-value.

```Image was here: The image displays a Python code snippet designed to count the number of Wednesdays within a specified date range, from August 9, 1986, to June 12, 2012. The code utilizes the `datetime` module, importing `date` and `timedelta`. Variables defined include `start_date` initialized to `date(1986, 8, 9)` and `end_date` set to `date(2012, 6, 12)`. A loop iterates through each day in the specified date range, checking if the current day (obtained via `current_date.weekday()`) equals 2, which corresponds to Wednesday. The count of Wednesdays is incremented in `wednesday_count` and printed in the format "Number of Wednesdays: [wednesday_count]." The surrounding UI elements suggest a query context, likely from a forum or programming discussion platform, indicating user engagement in solving a date arithmetic problem. The bottom section contains a query about the number of Wednesdays in that date range, confirming the user's focus on extracting specific date information through programming.```Neutral Minimal Photo Collage Mood Board Instagram Story1080×1920 119 KB

@Jivraj @carlton
The same issue is happening in the question 12 of GA1. I have given the answer by using collab and gemini , its giving the proper result but showing wrong.
```Image was here: The image displays a code snippet in a text editor, likely within a Python environment. The visible code involves reading from a file, specifically indicating the use of functions to handle encoding detection and manage potential errors related to file reading. It employs a structure for opening files in binary mode and checking if the specified path can be found, using error handling to manage exceptions. The references to "encoding" in the method indicate that the code is working with text data, potentially to ensure proper handling of different character encodings. Below this, a separate console output shows a variable assignment and iterates through some data, with a focus on analyzing file content. The output includes Python syntax such as loops and conditionals, likely for processing data or debugging purposes. The right side of the image features a video still, incompletely visible, with a man discussing computer-related topics, but no specific technical content is presented from that portion. Overall, the focus of the visible code is on file I/O operations, error management, and data processing within a software engineering context.```Minimal Square Photo Collage Photography Instagram Post1080×1080 126 KB

Hi Shouvik,
Your code seems correct to me. I think there is an extra space before your answer in input box.
Btw instead of using a while loop, there is a much more optimal, which uses difference of dates and doesn’t require a loop at all. Try to figure it out.

Hello Gentlemen Instructors,
In all the video lectures, I am first required to download the tools, install them on my computer ? Is it not going to overload my computer’s RAM etc.,
In one of the classes, you said that there is something  - colab like cloud wherein we can go and practice without overloading our own computers. Will you please let me know how to go about it ??
Thanks and regards,

```Image was here: The image displays a terminal interface from PowerShell, showcasing file hashing operations performed on a Markdown file named `formatted.md`. The user executes commands using PowerShell and NPX, specifically invoking `Get-FileHash` with the `SHA256` algorithm to retrieve the file's hash. The commands return the same SHA256 hash value of `216375D6F51AD49EB63502521E9F0A7395A0B2988D58ED657D956E88B1AD175` for `formatted.md`, confirming consistency across approach. Additionally, the command `certutil -hashfile formatted.md SHA256` is used to demonstrate the hash output for the same file, validating the successful execution of the command with the message "CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully."

Sha256sum is not recognized as an internal or external command how to solve this plzz answer
@carlton

**Post ID:** 582210

If you are on windows, you might not be able to use sha256sum.
Here are two disussions that might help you out.

Discussion 1
Discussion 2

**Post ID:** 582264

@Rohitkumar7463 @23f2003845
If you are on Windows Powershell
Then instead of sha256sum you can simply use Get-FileHash
Send the output of the npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md to a text file eg. output.txt and then use Get-FileHash on powershell with the output.txt and it will use sha256 by default and give you the exact same output.
You might be able to pipe the data directly to Get-FileHash but I have not tried direct piping. The above method works guaranteed.

@s.anand Sir
as you said in the previous post, the evaluation script is also updated based on errors other students point out.
I am submitting my answers as soon as the GA is released and stopping once I get 10/10.
Will you reevaluate the answers once the deadline is over? Or the marks I see right now will be set in stone?
If you will, then it will be based on the updated evaluation script which can reduce my marks.
```Image was here: The image displays a user interface that indicates a specific date and time of "6 Jan 2025 at 11:59 PM IST" alongside a score display reading "Score: 10 / 10."

The interface includes a blue button labeled "Reload" which implies interactive functionality, potentially for refreshing the current state or content. The overall design suggests a web application likely related to tracking performance, code assessments, or user progress within a software development or educational context.

```Image was here: The image displays a terminal output resembling a directory listing, formatted to show files along with their attributes. It includes four columns: "Length," "Date," "Time," and "Name." The "Length" column indicates the size of the files in bytes, with values 4094, 8410, 8062, and 9748. The "Date" column specifies the last modified dates of the files, presenting dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD: 2004-03-10, 2007-02-11, 2000-01-26, and 2010-09-27. The "Time" column shows the corresponding last modified times in HH:MM format. The "Name" column lists the files as "file0.txt," "file1.txt," "file2.txt," and "file3.txt." This listing is characteristic of file management in a command-line interface, possibly on a Unix-like operating system.

Good Evening, I have a doubt regarding the SQL Question I have attached my query. Please clarify me where I got wrong. I tried changing the gold string to lower and checking it. Even,  that didn’t work.
```Image was here: The image depicts a SQL query and an associated error message related to a ticket sales calculation. It presents a task asking for the total sales of items categorized under the "Gold" ticket type, specifically prompting for SQL code to perform the calculation.

This query attempts to sum the product of `Units` and `Price` from a table named `tickets` where the ticket type matches 'Gold'. Below the query, an error message is displayed, indicated as "Error: Got [42801]," suggesting a problem with the query execution. The text further specifies that the intended functionality is to retrieve all entries where the `Type` is "Gold", while also noting the need to ignore variations in spelling (like GOLD or gold) and to treat them as equivalent to 'Gold'.

```Image was here: The image contains instructions for downloading and extracting a ZIP file named `q-list-files-attributes.zip`. It specifies the use of the `ls` command with options to list the files in the extracted folder, including their modification dates and file sizes. The task requires calculating the total size of all files that are at least 2404 bytes large and modified on or after a specific date: March 18, 2002, at 1:02 AM IST. An input field is provided for users to input their answer, which currently shows a message indicating that the input was incorrect. Additionally, there is a warning against using Windows Explorer to unzip the archive, as it can destroy file timestamps. It advises using extraction tools like `unzip` or `7-Zip` to ensure the timestamps are preserved. This scenario likely involves a Linux or Unix-like command-line interface context.```image846×347 28.4 KB

Q18 GA1
I don’t get what’s wrong with this:
```Image was here: The image contains a snippet from a technical forum discussing a SQL query related to a `tickets` table within a SQLite database. The table has columns labeled `type`, `units`, and `price`, with visible entries including values for ticket types such as "Silver," "gold," and "BRONZE," showing the corresponding unit counts and prices per unit. The primary task is to calculate the total sales of all items of the "Gold" ticket type. A specific SQL query is provided: `select sum(units*price) from tickets where type='gold' collate nocase;`. An error message appears below indicating a problem with the execution, specifically "Error: Got [129444.59]...". The context suggests debugging the SQL query to handle variations in the "Gold" ticket type while summing the sales correctly. The image involves SQL, SQLite, and possibly concepts of data sales aggregation and query collations for case insensitivity.```image1269×561 42 KB

```Image was here: The image displays a user interface related to a technical guide, specifically focused on using `npx` and the `prettier` code formatter. It instructs users to download a file named `README.md` and confirms that the file should maintain that specific name in the user's directory. The command provided is `npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum`, which is intended to beautify the Markdown file and generate its SHA-256 checksum. Below the command execution prompt, the output of the command is displayed: "SHA256 AC06784D6825497650083DDFD6746A2CDD561B6A1FF45241C6A354035244A75C," indicating successful execution and providing the expected checksum for verification. This interaction likely occurs in a terminal interface, reflecting a debugging or validation activity in a JavaScript environment.```image1199×236 8.5 KB

```Image was here: The image displays a technical forum question regarding the conversion of multi-cursor edits into a JSON object. It instructs users to download a file named `q-multi-cursor.json.txt` and to utilize a tool that requires the conversion of key-value pairs into the format `{key: value, ...}`. The text prompts the user to paste the resulting JSON into a URL, specifically `tools-in-data-science.pages.dev/jsonhash`, and click the Hash button to generate a hash value. Below the prompt, an error message indicates the response was incorrect, along with a hash-like string `c0b94a267358720193d8b6497c0d810d8305805d02f840b4ba36a1536` suggesting a failed validation. The context indicates a focus on JSON manipulation and validation, pertinent to software development, possibly in a coding or data science environment. The visible technologies likely involve JSON data handling tools and could imply the use of JavaScript or web-based development frameworks.```image1635×317 28 KB
i am not getting why my answer is showing incorrect.
can you help me in this ? @Saransh_Saini @Jivraj

Check the structure of your json object. It should be {key1: value1, key2: value2}. Also make sure you enclose the keys and values in double-quotes, and after every key-value pair put a comma.

**Post ID:** 585081

i am doing so only … i can send u the example -
{   “0”: “wEfsmtde”,
“83”: “NghqzO3DL”,
“NqN7EcM”: “I”,
“vFD2C”: “KAB”}
i am not able to find what’s the mistake

**Post ID:** 585113

Your format seems to be correct, but cause you are still facing that problem then these are the few reasons I can think of

Check the entire JSON object and make sure that each and every element follows this format.
Use Chrome for getting that hash code, it could be the case that some other browser may not be pasting the object as intended.

**Post ID:** 585132

Okay, i will go through my json object once.
And for hash code i am using chrome only

Hello Sir,
I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed regarding my Week 1 graded assignment for the Tools in Data Science course.
I successfully completed the assignment and received a score of 80 out of 100. However, when I checked the course portal, it is showing my status as “absent” for this particular assignment.
I wanted to ensure that this information is corrected in the system to accurately reflect my participation and performance. Could you please look into this matter and update my grade accordingly?

It shows a notification that the exam ended on January 26, 2025, at 11:59 PM IST, accompanied by a score indicator currently set to zero and buttons for "Check all" and "Save". The interface includes a prompt for users to join a discussion on Discourse and displays the logged-in user’s email address (23f3001601@ds.study.iitm.ac.in) with a "Logout" option.

@s.anand Linking this tutorial for markdown. Maybe you can consider including it in the next iteration of the course?
I’ve created a PR for the same on GitHub! Please have a look and let me know what you think Prof!
