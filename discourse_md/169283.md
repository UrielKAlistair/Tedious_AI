The answer choices for questions 1 and 2 in graded assignment 6 are quite confusing. Both questions are single-select, yet three out of the four options are correct in each case. I’m unsure whether to choose one of the correct options or if the question is actually asking for the incorrect one. Could someone please clarify?

@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
I have similar concern
For Q1, I used the following code:
print(f'Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column')
kk = df[df['State'] == 'Karnataka']
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = kk['price_retention'].corr(kk[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

And got the following output:
Pearson correlation for Karnataka between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.03
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.04

Whereas options are below where none of them are correct.
```Image was here: The image displays a series of radio buttons corresponding to different parameters likely associated with a machine learning model or statistical analysis, showing the labels 'Mileage', 'AvgDistance', and 'EngineCapacity' along with their respective numeric values. Specifically, 'Mileage: 0.95' and 'Mileage: 0.21' have unselected radio buttons, while 'AvgDistance: -0.05' is selected, indicating a focus on this parameter. The 'EngineCapacity: 0.17' option also remains unselected. This configuration suggests a user interface element from a web application or software tool that allows users to select variables for model training or evaluation, possibly within a context of automotive data analytics or predictive modeling involving vehicle characteristics.```image281×219 9.1 KB
Whereas for Q2 (Punjab and Yamaha) I used the following code:
print(f'Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column')
pb = df[(df['State'] == 'Punjab') & (df['Brand'] == 'Yamaha')]
for col in ['Mileage (km/l)', 'Avg Daily Distance (km)', 'Engine Capacity (cc)']:
    pearson_corr = pb['price_retention'].corr(pb[col])
    print(f'\t{col:25} : {pearson_corr:.2f}')

and got the following answers:
Pearson correlation for Punjab and Yamaha between price retention and column
	Mileage (km/l)            : 0.24
	Avg Daily Distance (km)   : -0.06
	Engine Capacity (cc)      : -0.08

The options for Q2 are given below and 2 of them are correct (AvgDistance and Mileage).
```Image was here: The image displays a selection of metrics related to a data analysis context, likely within a machine learning or statistical evaluation interface. It contains four labeled entries: 'Mileage: 0.95', 'AvgDistance: -0.06', 'Mileage: 0.24' (highlighted with a blue circle indicating selection), and 'EngineCapacity: -0.08'. The metrics, particularly the repeated 'Mileage' labels, suggest a comparison of features or attributes, potentially used for model evaluation or input feature selection. The variation in numerical values indicates a focus on feature importance or correlation in a predictive model, typical in contexts such as regression analysis or performance metrics assessment within a data science pipeline. The presentation suggests interaction via a user interface, possibly from a tool like Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, or other analytics platforms used for exploratory data analysis or feature significance evaluation.```image278×216 9.19 KB

I used a python script to get the solution to quesiton 1 of week 6 graded assignment. It matches three options. Is this a bug or like we then need to analyze using the pearson coefficient to determine which option is the correct one
```Image was here: The image displays a questionnaire from a technical evaluation scenario related to motorcycle resale value analysis. It features a multiple-choice question with three key variables: "Mileage," "AvgDistance," and "EngineCapacity," with specific values alongside each option. The "EngineCapacity" has a highlighted value of 0.13, indicating it may be the selected or most relevant metric for the analysis. The context revolves around statistical analysis, specifically employing the Pearson Correlation Coefficient to assess the impact of these variables on price retention for Yamaha motorcycles in Delhi. The values provided suggest the exploration of relationships between engine capacity and resale pricing, with specific attention to data-driven decisions in a strategic consulting role.```image1383×263 25 KB

Dear Sirs, Can we have some response on these issues related particularly to the questions 1 and 2 of Graded Assignment 6. It looks like multiple options are correct in the given options. Any guidance or hint, on how to arrive at the right answer will be helpful. Thanks and regards. @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

**Post ID:** 604590

Yeah…Even I am facing the same issue. Out of the 4 options provided, 3 options are correct in my case both for Q1 & Q2, but both these questions are single-choice questions. Kindly look into it and help us out @carlton !

**Post ID:** 605292

I guess for both Q1 & Q2, we need to find the option that is having stronger correlation (positive/negative). Please correct me if I am wrong.

Any updates on these? I am too facing the same issue.
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini

**Post ID:** 605753

In GA6 for first 2 questions 3 out of 4 options are correct. Even the question is not clearly asking anything. Kindly suggest are we supposed to select the wrong one
```Image was here: The image contains a multiple-choice question from a technical assessment or quiz aimed at analyzing motorcycle resale value factors for a premium dealership chain in Maharashtra. The question outlines a task to evaluate the impact of three variables—mileage, average daily distance traveled, and engine capacity—on price retention, defined as the resale price divided by the original price. It features four options with corresponding Pearson Correlation Coefficient values, specifically highlighting "Mileage: 0.95" as the selected answer, while also listing "AvgDistance: 0.09" and "EngineCapacity: -0.02". The interface resembles an online examination or survey platform, indicating the utilization of statistical methods for data analysis in the context of business consulting for the automotive industry.```image2083×575 47.6 KB

@Jivraj @carlton @Saransh_Saini
Dear TDS Team,
There are multiple issues in Graded Assignment 6 that require urgent attention:

Questions 1 and 2, along with their options, are ambiguous.
In Questions 3 and 4, I am unable to obtain an exact answer that matches any of the given options, despite trying multiple approaches, including the Excel regression method and other models in a Google Colab file.
The data for Question 10 is missing. I attempted to run the shapefile in QGIS, but it resulted in an error. Additionally, I searched for the shapefile of New York roads on official websites, but their servers are currently under maintenance.

The assignment deadline is approaching, but these issues remain unresolved. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and provide a resolution as soon as possible.
Thank you for your support.

**Post ID:** 605995

Yes, there are no specifics in Q1 to Q4 and are quite ambiguous.
For instance:

forecast the 2027 resale value of the Hero - HF Deluxe in Gujarat, using historical data.

but is this talking about the average resale value as no input features are specified?

**Post ID:** 606007

Let’s wait for their response.
I submitted nearby option for Q3 and Q4

My question 7 for GA6 is :
A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance
Whose options provided are :
10418 meters
12287 meters
10965 meters
11149 meters
However, after trying all methods out there my distance comes out to be 6873 meters, I selected 10418 as the answer (closest approximation to 6873 meters)
I assume that the question must have been central command post to summit shores village (whose answer turns out to be 12287 meters)
Kindly look into the question, and let me know about the same (the destination from central command post)

My question 9 for GA6 is :
@carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
```Image was here: The image displays Python code that utilizes the `haversine` library to calculate geographical distances between several community locations and a central command post. Key variables defined include the coordinates for four communities: OakParkTown, EastSpringsSettlement, EastFieldsJunction, and RedPointTown, along with the CentralCommandPostLocation. A dictionary named `distances` is constructed to store the calculated distances using the `haversine` function for each community against the central command post. The code sorts these communities based on their distances and stores them in `optimal_sequence`. Finally, it prints an evacuation sequence that details each community's distance to the command post, formatted to two decimal places. The console output lists each community with its corresponding distance in kilometers, such as EastFieldsJunction (7.84 km) and OakParkTown (11.76 km). The code is likely executed within a Python development environment, perhaps using an IDE like VSCode.```Screenshot 2025-03-15 205444878×668 38.1 KB

Hello Sir,
Can you please check if this is the right answer. As per email received from @carlton sir we should select the absolute maximum value.
```Image was here: The image displays a question from a technical assessment related to data analysis in the context of motorcycle resale value evaluation in Uttar Pradesh. The central task is to analyze various factors—specifically, mileage (in km), engine capacity (in liters), and average daily distance traveled—all of which impact the price retention of Royal Enfield motorcycles, calculated as a percentage. The visible options for answers include numeric values for different metrics: Mileage (0.01), EngineCapacity (0.95), AvgDistance (-0.13), and EngineCapacity (0.09). An error message indicates that the selected answer was incorrect, leading to a score of 0. Additionally, accepted answers are presented at the bottom, confirming that 'EngineCapacity: 0.09' is the correct option. This scenario may involve statistical analysis techniques like Pearson Correlation Coefficient to derive relationships between the factors and price retention. Consideration of economic indicators and data types may be relevant in this analytical exercise.```image978×393 23.3 KB
Example : If we get answers as -0.3 and 0.2 then -0.3 is the right answer as it’s absolut value is maximum.
For the first question the correlation matrix is as follows,
```Image was here: The image displays a correlation matrix represented as a heatmap, highlighting relationships between various automotive metrics: "Mileage (km/l)", "Avg Daily Distance (km)", "Engine Capacity (cc)", and "Price Retention (%)". Each cell in the matrix contains correlation coefficients, with values ranging from -1 to +1, indicating the strength and direction of relationships among these metrics. The color gradient ranges from blue (indicating negative correlations) to red (indicating positive correlations). Notable observations include a perfect positive correlation (1.00) for "Engine Capacity (cc)" with itself and a significant negative correlation (-0.13) between "Mileage (km/l)" and "Avg Daily Distance (km)". The presence of these correlations suggests an analytical approach to understanding how different factors impact vehicle performance and resale value in a statistical or data analysis context.```image748×431 17.5 KB
So shouldn’t it be -0.13?

I did raise the question 2 days before the GA6 Deadline and doing so again after being marked as incorrect
My question 7 was A wildfire is threatening a rural mountain region, and emergency services need to coordinate evacuation routes for four remote communities. The Emergency Management Center is located at a central command post, and must plan the most efficient evacuation route to ensure rapid and safe community evacuation. The four communities are: Silver Springs Community : (42.1029,-85.665) ;Pleasant Harbor Community : (42.1238,-85.9043);Summit Shores Village : (42.0415,-85.8696);River Retreat Outpost : (42.0417,-85.6836) & Central Command Post Location: (42.0587,-85.7226) Using the Haversine package, calculate the distance from the Central Command Post to Silver Springs Community. Which of the following is the MOST ACCURATE distance
10418 meters
12287 meters
10965 meters
11149 meters
Whose right answer turned out 6873, however the answer pushed is 12287 meters, which is nowhere near the closest options (it would’ve been correct if the destination was summit shores village which isn’t the case with this question)
Also, my question 4 was :
As an investment analyst monitoring motorcycle resale values, develop a forecasting model to predict future resale prices by brand and segment, considering seasonality and long-term trends. Specifically, forecast the 2027 resale value of the Kawasaki - Ninja 300 in Tamil Nadu, using historical data.
134483
94774
150666
199711
Whose correct option (through different methods and algorithms) was approximately closest to 94774 and again answer pushed is 150666 which again turns out to be incorrect
So is the case with questions 1 and 2 (where answers aren’t pushed according to absolute values, but as conveyed earlier, I believe this shall be resolved)
Kindly look into it
Thanks and Regards
