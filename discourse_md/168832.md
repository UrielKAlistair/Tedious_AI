Would we be able to start work on the questions 1 hour before the exam start time?

**Post ID:** 601568

@bhashwar_sengupta No that will not be possible. It will go live only at 1 pm.

**Post ID:** 601588

Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs?

**Post ID:** 601648

Is it 45 minutes long?

**Post ID:** 601788

No, it is 45 minutes ‘short’

**Post ID:** 601833

@carlton will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like we had for Weekly GA?

**Post ID:** 601837

Hello @carlton sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings?

**Post ID:** 601950

All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving component. These are all available on the Youtube channel

**Post ID:** 602053

Sir we have to join the google meet for ROE or it’s an open book exam?

**Post ID:** 602055

Is there a google meet that we have to join for proctoring?

**Post ID:** 602070

@carlton
I hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is there any update regarding the additional time request? Can we expect any consideration on this?
I submitted my request at the following link:

The exam link is working now.

**Post ID:** 602142

were you able to resolve it ?

**Post ID:** 602146

Yup! Based on previous GAs, 45 minutes seems pretty short.

**Post ID:** 602147

HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO ACCESS ANSWERS, WHETHER THEY ARE CORRECT OR INCORRECT. JUST LIKE IN GAs?? will we have a “check” button??

**Post ID:** 602149

Its fine the link is correct. Just that the exam is not available at the moment, we have changed the error message. Exam will start at 1pm. Its also hackable to start before.

**Post ID:** 602151

You will have a check button

**Post ID:** 602152

We have updated the error message.

**Post ID:** 602153

yes … us ai, phone a friend, also ping here…

**Post ID:** 602154

ping here? does that mean we are allowed to discuss here?

**Post ID:** 602164

No this thread is only for technical doubts faced by students.
But, you can create another thread to discuss it. Thats much encouraged.

**Post ID:** 602203

Thank you Teachers for a great preparation using mock it helped us a lot and really very difficult but interesting exam.

**Post ID:** 602204

Thanks all for ROE exam. Got 9/10 , mostly guessing many might have got full as prev. mocks conducted in last week was used.

@carlton @Saransh_Saini   Sir, can you please tell me why this was not accepted? here is my code:
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url, headers=headers)
            return response.text
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

here are the responses:

thanks a ton @carlton and to all the TAs. Performed much better in ROE than I expected!!

**Post ID:** 602215

ROE was challenging, but definitely Mocks helped a lot. I think mocks were the best preparation for ROE. Did good because of it.

**Post ID:** 602216

Your answer is absolutely correct @23f2000573
But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.

**Post ID:** 602218

Hello Sir"s, @carlton @Saransh_Saini
I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.
I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode

Hi @Muthupalaniappan
We have got multiple issues like from other students, we are looking into it and figuring out what all we can do.

**Post ID:** 602222

Even I had this issue but it was given in question to round off so once rounded off, i would taken as correct

**Post ID:** 602223

Hello  @carlton
@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini as I already showed you in the meet that while submitting it was already showing 10, and for surety and safety i clicked on SAVE Button, on resaving now it’s showing 0 and dint get submitted properly…
As you can see from your records, I have already finished and submitted everything correctly. This carries a lot of weight and will significantly impact my grade, therefore I kindly ask that you take this into account and give me full marks. So i beg you sir for considering my request sir, also attaching the screenshot as you instructed in the meet for your reference sir.

Hello @carlton / @Saransh_Saini
I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two.

Please consider accepting my submission

**Post ID:** 602230

you have to filter students with marks 30 or more in maths not biology and then answer to question is total biology mark you have found the total maths mark

**Post ID:** 602233

Also @s.anand @carlton @Jivraj @Saransh_Saini sir found my previous submissions scores and times:
On 1:17:02PM Score -9
And on 1:20:01PM Score -10
and on 1:21:26PM Score -10
So sir you can please verify with your records and i hope you grant me full marks for this ROE sir.

Hello @carlton / @Saransh_Saini
I  am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.
Could you please consider my request?
Thank you.

Sir, I’m facing the same issue. While the recent scores say I have a score of 10, my final score shows 0. Kindly look into this, and please consider the highest marks from recent saves.
Thank you.

**Post ID:** 602379

The same happened to me before the exam. Fortunately, I saw it before, and charged my laptop.

**Post ID:** 602387

Charging wasnt an issue for me, my entire vsc just froze and the screen went blank during the last 5 mins. That was exactly when i got the code for q6 and was trying to get the output and it froze, reopened at 1:45 and the time was up

**Post ID:** 602959

Hi @23f2000778
No need to worry about that, I have checked in backend your score is 10 of 10.
kind regards

**Post ID:** 602962

Hi @21f3002158
I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.
Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.
There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.
Kind regards

We will consider your submission of 10 marks since that’s maximum one.
Kind regards

**Post ID:** 602980

Hi @22f1000535
We will be giving 2 minutes allowance, answers before 1:47:00 will be evaluated, so you submitted at 1:46 so you will get 8 out of 10.

**Post ID:** 602981

Hi @Muthupalaniappan
We have decided to give 2 minutes of allowance for network problems to everyone, so whoever submitted before 1:47:00 will be evaluated, your submission was at 2025-03-02 13:47:43 with 2 marks
Kind regard

**Post ID:** 602984

@carlton @Jivraj sir,  I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and  finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that
Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process
Thank you for giving us this amazing opportunity

9 marks? How were you able to crack the ROE?

**Post ID:** 602957

Hi @24f2003130
Your last submission before 1:47:00 was at 2025-03-02 13:42:34 with	8 marks, we will consider that.
Kind regards

**Post ID:** 602968

The questions were really similar to the GAs and mocks…I practiced them beforehand and had code snippets ready to use…so I guess that was helpful

**Post ID:** 602982

Ok sir
Also I have realised the value of 28 seconds since my last submission (9/10) was at 1:47:28
I respect the rules of the exam and will be more careful in the future exams to avoid such technical glitches.

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.

There was a technical support meeting going between 1 Pm to 1:50 pm on ROE day, you were expected to join that meeting. You didn’t join technical support meet before deadline.

Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it.

**Post ID:** 602997

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.

Hi @Jayeshbansal
Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.
I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.

i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)

Hello sir, @Jivraj
Do you mean you will not consider them for evaluation then?

**Post ID:** 603009

Yes, it won’t be considered.

**Post ID:** 603011

yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save

**Post ID:** 603014

Sorry @Jayeshbansal All your submissions were around 7 hours after 1:47:00 Pm, that’s why we won’t consider them for evaluation.
Kind regards

Hi @23f3002537
The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version.
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

Hello @Jivraj sir,
Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.
I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.
Please re consider this request sir.

**Post ID:** 603029

@Jivraj Could you please verify if my score will be accepted by you? I saved only once: at 1:47 pm. My roll number is 21f2001573.

**Post ID:** 603073

@Jivraj @Saransh_Saini
When will the results of ROE will out.

**Post ID:** 603124

Probably, by this week

**Post ID:** 603125

I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it.
Regards

**Post ID:** 603134

Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).
Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered.
I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.
Please reconsider if possible.

They only started pushing the scores a few minutes ago, so just wait for the update to finish. Check again and confirm after a few hours.
Thanks

**Post ID:** 604232

Am facing the same issue sir, will wait a few hours and update… I ensured I submitted atleast 5 times till 1:45

**Post ID:** 604292

I submitted 5 times minimum before 1:45 with a score of 7 @Jivraj @carlton out of curiosity i also submitted thrice after exam at like 2 or so just to know how to solve the other qs withscore of 9. I will get the 7 considered right? I submitted them at like 1:43 or so. Please confirm. It still shows absent

@Jivraj @carlton
Do we get bonus marks for submitting the student feedback Google Form?

**Post ID:** 604438

Sir , it is still showing absent for me for Roe result, I had submitted before the deadline as well my score was 2/10 but the result is showing absent. Can u please look into this and revert

**Post ID:** 604573

Any updates sir ? @carlton @Jivraj  It was told, it will be updated in a few hours and now it’s been a day. Am scared!

**Post ID:** 604593

Dont worry, we have the right scores on our server. There has been some problem in sending the export to the operations team. Your scores are safe. We are working on figuring out the problem. Even the bonus marks are recorded. Just give us a couple of days to sort it out. Many students have been affected so we cant give individual responses right now. Its a system fix that needs to be implemented.

**Post ID:** 604761

Respected Sir,
I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM.
Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last.
Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time.
Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted

The latest submission before the deadline would be 3 marks. That is what would be considered.

**Post ID:** 604817
