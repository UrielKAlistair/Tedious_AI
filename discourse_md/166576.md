@23f1002630 - thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re-occur for anyone.
What happened? I picked random duration from the video of 10-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

It was solved but again I’m facing the same issue

**Post ID:** 593671

@s.anand @Jivraj  I’m still facing the issue.

**Post ID:** 593896

i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the data in OpenRefine 2-3 times but still getting incorrect in the portal.

**Post ID:** 594108

OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right. Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous discourse posts.

Wrong / Confusing question Prof

**Post ID:** 595057

Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked-
Thank you

**Post ID:** 595100

I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.
Please consider my request and double check-
@Jivraj, @carlton

Respected @carlton
I am facing an issue with GA5 Q5, as my answer is being marked incorrect despite multiple attempts. I have processed data at OpenRefine .
To ensure accuracy, I also tried a manual approach by converting the JSON file to Excel and filtering the data, but I arrived at the same answer each time. However, the assignment portal still shows it as incorrect.
Sir Could you please check portal expected answer for this question.
Thankyou

I have checked your dataset along with your params, and its perfectly correct. Try again and check your step.
Otherwise go and watch 18-Feb Live Session

@Saransh_Saini
Q5 fixed, thanks for fixing the issue.
Now we are struggling with Q8.
MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called post_id , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.
when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post_id but error : Error: At root: Array length mismatch
Reason:  below query checking only 1st comment ($[0] refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st.
But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.
WITH filtered_posts AS (
  SELECT post_id
  FROM social_media
  WHERE timestamp >= '2025-01-09T09:48:01.303Z'
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM social_media AS sm
      WHERE json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') IS NOT NULL
        AND CAST(json_extract_path_text(sm.comments, '$[0].stars.useful') AS INTEGER) > 4
    )
)
SELECT post_id
FROM filtered_posts
ORDER BY post_id ASC;

Kindly check if any issue with Q8.
May be my query is wrong or may be not.
Thankyou

**Post ID:** 597221

@lakshaygarg654
Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug.
Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end.
In this case its an ordered post_id
So thats where you begin:
SELECT post_id
FROM (
...
)
ORDER BY post_id

Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet.
Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity.
You will still need the post_id for the outermost layer so you have to continue extracting it from the inner layers of the nested query.
...
...
FROM (
   SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars
   FROM social_media
   WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given)
      AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given)
)
...
...

Then the final layer of the nest
...
...
(

) as max_stars
...
...

You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability)
But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades.
Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional.
Kind regards

**Post ID:** 597225

Its been done. You will get a more detailed error now. And we have relaxed the number of errors allowed (it actually did have a tolerance limit but it was fairly tight)

**Post ID:** 597255

sir even after applying this logic im getting error at root: array length mismatch

**Post ID:** 597259

@daksh76 thats because your innermost logic layer must not return a long list of results.
If you think about it logically each row cannot have a column field where one of the columns is a whole row of results right?
Thats why you are getting the error.
Check your innermost layer is returning a single value or a row of results.
Kind regards

**Post ID:** 597263

Thank you for your response @carlton. You are absolutely right—my query was unnecessarily complex. Initially, I attempted a simpler approach, using various JSON extraction functions. However, I encountered multiple errors, including:

json_extract: “Table Function with name ‘json_extract’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”
json_each: “Table Function with name ‘json_each’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”
json_extract_path_text: “Table Function with name ‘json_extract_path_text’ is not in the catalog. A function by this name exists in the JSON extension but is of a different type, namely Scalar Function.”

Since the simple approach did not work, I attempted a more complex query to achieve the desired result. However, that too did not yield the expected output. To gain better insight, I extracted ten values into a table using the console and then reconstructed the query accordingly. Unfortunately, I am still facing issues related to functions not being recognized in the catalog.
I would appreciate any guidance on resolving this issue. I do not need the exact answer; I just want to know if there is any issue with the portal for Q8.
Thankyou

In this question, I am asked to find the total margin for transactions before Tue, Jun 14, 2022, 04:52:52 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time) for Theta sold in the US (which may be spelled in different ways).
However, when I filter in Excel for US and Theta, there are no entries for Sales and Cost. But 0 as the answer is not accepted—it says the answer is incorrect.
(I cross-checked this using GPT.)

**Post ID:** 597380

@23f2004313
US is also called
United States
United States of America
USA
These are all valid references to US

**Post ID:** 597387

I have replaced all the different names of US (all ) as “US” .
also sorted the dates as asked in the question .

**Post ID:** 597394

I have checked your GA and I do get sales entries for the criteria in your GA.
Please remember that this module is about data cleaning. And that data needs to be sanitised before you start filtering.

For Q8, I wrote the following query,
SELECT smo.post_id
FROM social_media as smo
WHERE smo.timestamp >= '2024-11-15T06:02:28.656Z'
AND EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM LATERAL (
       SELECT UNNEST(json_extract(comments, '$[*]'))
       FROM social_media as sm
       WHERE sm.post_id = smo.post_id
       ) AS c(value)
    WHERE json_extract(c.value, '$.stars.useful')::DOUBLE = 4)
order by smo.post_id;

What it does is for each post_id, checks the timestamp and then checks the presence of a json object in comments that has 4 stars useful rating for this post_id. Finally returns all the post_id’s in ascending order.
But it’s giving me an Array length mismatch error. I’m stuck here. Any hints would be helpful. @Jivraj @carlton
P.S. I also noticed that the timestamp given in the question keeps changing with each page reload. But the output from the query stays the same.

QUESTION 9
I was supposed to transcribe the audio of the provided video for a certain time period. After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.
Here was my transcription - " Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.
In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”
The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.
Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.
