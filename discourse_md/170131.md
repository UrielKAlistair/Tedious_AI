In every TDS assignment after the first, I have not seen a submit button in the assignment page so I could not submit it there( I see it in the sanand portal and submit it there)
Now, my assignment score for all assignments (2,3,4,5) shows 0
I am attaching SS of my assignment-5 page to show there was no submit button available there
I had raised this as a ticket in the Support desk(21/Feb) in the past as discourse was not available to me at that time, but this didn’t get resolved. I saw a similar older thread where it was mentioned that this is not something to worry about but now it is showing in the portal that I am not allowed to take the End Term Exam. What can be done for this?
```Image was here: The image depicts a web interface from an educational platform, specifically showing a page for "Graded Assignment 5" under a course module titled "Deployment Tools". The assignment is due on "2025-02-21, 23:59 IST". Key details include instructions for submission, stating that multiple submissions can be made prior to the deadline for grading purposes. There are troubleshooting tips for accessing the assignment, advising users to disable ad blockers, use Chrome as the preferred browser, and disable any overly aggressive anti-virus software. The student is required to enter their student ID (formatted with "xxxxxxx@iitm.ac.in") to access the assignment, which is linked to an external URL: "https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ids-2025-01-q5". The interface includes navigation elements for course modules, access to grades, and support options, consistent with an online learning environment. It suggests a context of remote coursework submission and technical considerations in an educational setting.```SS1895×1010 167 KB

@22f3001561 GA5 like all the prior GAs for TDS Jan 25 term were all to be submitted through the graded assignment page. Which is in the link provided (it is actually in the screen shot you have provided).
All the previous GA 1 through 4 were also exactly the same.
We have no evidence you ever submitted any of the other GAs except GA1.
Kind regards
