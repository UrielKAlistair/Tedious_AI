Mail I received Yesterday:
```Image was here: The image presents an evaluation checklist for a software engineering project, specifically for Project 1 of a technical learning program hosted on a website referred to as "TDS." The communication is directed toward a learner, emphasizing the need to meet several prerequisite checks concerning their GitHub repository and Docker image. Specific items listed include: 1) The GitHub repository must exist and be publicly accessible; 2) The repository must contain a LICENSE file with the MIT license; 3) It must have a valid Dockerfile; 4) The Docker image must be publicly accessible and runnable with a specified command using podman, including environment variables; 5) The Dockerfile used must match the one in the GitHub repository. Each prerequisite is assessed with results: the Docker image is noted as present and public (PASS), while the GitHub repository fails on public accessibility, presence of the Dockerfile, and inclusion of the MIT license (FAIL). The surrounding context indicates a focus on utilizing Docker and GitHub for managing the project, highlighting technologies vital for containerization and version control in software development.```Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-01-071174×451 54.2 KB
Previous Correct Evaluation Mail:
```Image was here: The image contains correspondence addressed to a learner regarding the evaluation of a project 1 Docker image submission. Key elements include a list of files to provide, such as an Evaluation log file (indicating performance metrics from Docker Hub), a Docker file link for the project, server start log details, and evaluation script specifics. The message also mentions an issue with server time, indicating that the server was misconfigured, resulting in missed evaluation criteria. The Docker orchestration file for managing container launch configuration is referenced, as well as a solution script attached for project resolution. The evaluation process and scoring issues are highlighted, indicating a need for further feedback and the possibility of score adjustments based on discrepancies in script behavior. The overall context suggests an assessment of a Dockerized application involving cloud infrastructure and scripting for automated evaluation.```Screenshot from 2025-04-01 09-02-351687×650 144 KB
Good Morning Sir,
This is my github repo: GitHub - kohliaryan/TDS_Project_1 ()You can verify that it is public, MIT License is present and Dockerfile is also present.)
I also got a mail 2 days ago in which everything is mentioned correctly but the mail I got yesterday worry me.  Sir, I have worked really hard for project 1. Please look into this matter.

Apologies for that,
The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.
Kind regards

Hi @carlton,
I’m experiencing the same issue mentioned in this thread regarding Project 1 evaluation emails:

The first email I received confirmed all requirements were met (public repo, MIT License, Dockerfile, etc.)
The second email incorrectly flagged missing files despite their presence in my repository

Here are screenshots of both emails showing the discrepancy:
```Image was here: The image presents an email discussing the evaluation of a Docker image submission for a software engineering project. Key elements include the mention of a Docker file, server log files, and evaluation scripts attached for detailed inspection of the submission process. The communication addresses issues with the Docker image, specifically highlighting that the image was misconfigured or unresponsive, with performance metrics indicating a significant delay in load times— at least five minutes— due to network bandwidth limitations. Specific attachments referenced include performance reports for individual tasks, detailed logs for a server running on an x86 architecture, an evaluation script for the executed tasks, and a Docker orchestration file necessary for the container's operation. The email emphasizes the importance of configuration and performance, indicating that failure to adhere to requirements may affect scores. Furthermore, a clarification is provided on the usage of a specific application scripting function, suggesting an educational context, possibly within a course framework involving Docker and software deployment best practices. The last part of the email notes a specific Docker image ID, indicating its relevance to the project's evaluation process.```First Evaluation Email1511×724 76.2 KB
```Image was here: The image displays an email that outlines the evaluation results for a technical project (TDS Project 1) primarily focused on GitHub repository requirements and Docker configurations. Key checks include verifying the visibility and accessibility of the GitHub repository, confirming the presence of a LICENSE file with the MIT license, validating a Dockerfile, and ensuring that the Docker image is publicly accessible while running a specific command with environment variables. The evaluation results indicate the status of each check: the GitHub repository is marked as public (PASS), but the presence of the Dockerfile and the MIT license is marked as failed (FAIL), leading to an overall project score of 0 out of possible points. Specific errors listed are "Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS," "Is GitHub repo present AND public: FAIL," "Is Dockerfile present at root of github repo: FAIL," and "Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL." The email serves as a communication tool for a learner, outlining prerequisites that must be met for project submission evaluation.```Second Evaluation Email1247×681 37.5 KB
My GitHub repo remains publicly accessible with all required components:
GitHub repo
Could you please confirm this was an automated error and that my submission will be evaluated based on the actual repository contents? Your clarification would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you for your time and assistance!

Hi,
Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

Good Morning Sir, Actually even I got the mail regarding Project-1 Evaluation, where I got the message like the prerequisites were not met. But, sir actually I have uploaded my MIT License file, requirements.txt file, my Project.py file and the Dockerfile. Sir, and when I sent a request to my API from my device, it worked sir. I have got 0 in my project 1 sir, but I have met the pre-requisites Can you please check this once sir?
My GitHub repository for Project-1: GitHub - sudhishssn134/project_1_tds
Thanking You
Just attaching the mail I recieved.
```Image was here: The image contains an email titled "TDS Jan 25 Project 1 Scores" from the user 'se2002,' which addresses a learner regarding their project 1 Docker image submission evaluation. The message highlights that certain files are marked as "MISSING," indicating potential issues either with the evaluation or with the Docker image itself. Key components discussed include instructions for submitting specific files: an evaluation log URL for individual performance metrics, a Docker log file linked through Google Drive for container performance, server log files related to the performance of ARM and x86 builds, an evaluation script for performance assessment, and a data generation file requisite for data creation tasks. The email emphasizes Docker orchestration, noting how it influences communication and function mapping. Additionally, it mentions a solution script to resolve project dependencies. The ID of the evaluated Docker image (7383202277180) is provided, and the context suggests a focus on improving software engineering practices, specifically in containerized application deployment and evaluation standards.```Screenshot 2025-04-12 1042111429×750 71 KB

Your Dockerfile was misconfigured. When we try to build the docker image from your github repo, we get this error:
tried copying parent folder(COPY failed: forbidden path outside the build context: .. ())
You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.

    To replicate the test environment: 
Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can  run this code using uv. 
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
# ]
# ///

import requests
import datetime as dt
import zoneinfo

Sir, I have extracted the files from the GitHub Repository, built my DockerFile withe the DockerImage I have posted. The build is successful and the dockerimage is also running sir. I have attached the screen shot below
```Image was here: The image displays a terminal output from a Docker build process, indicating various stages of building an application container. It shows the extraction of image layers with SHA256 identifiers and the transfer of build context, detailing the commands executed. Notably, it includes lines such as "WORKDIR /app" and "COPY requirements.txt /app/", which indicate the setup of the working directory and the copying of necessary files. The command "RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt" signifies the installation of Python dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file. Additional console outputs include logs stating "INFO: Started server process [1]" and "INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000", indicating that the application is starting and will be accessible via a Uvicorn ASGI server on port 8000. The path in the command suggests integration with environment variables for configuration, particularly referencing "AIPROXY_TOKEN". The context relates to deploying a Python application using Docker, explicitly using Uvicorn as the web server.```Screenshot 2025-04-12 1153421466×702 50.4 KB

URGENT ATTN REQ: technical discrepancy and inconsistency in the evaluation scripts of graded assignment and project 2 Tools in Data Science


    Project 1 : You tried to copy parent folder(Ref:line number 8 in your Dockerfile) but there is no parent folder with respect to github repo’s root folder, so it fails evaluation. 
Project 2 : Response we received through google form was http://127.0.0.1:8000/api which is local host url not a vercel endpoint.
